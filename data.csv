After tough talk between Presidents Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin over the Russian troop build-up on the Ukraine border, U.S. and Russia insist they are hopeful that a pathway to easing tensions could open during diplomatic talks set for January.But with less than two weeks to go before senior U.S. and Russian officials are to meet in Geneva, the chasm is deep and the prospect of finding an exit to the crisis faces no shortage of complications.Mr. Biden on Friday told reporters that he advised Mr. Putin when they spoke by phone a day earlier that the upcoming talks could only work if the Russian leader “deescalated, not escalated, the situation” in the days ahead.“I made it clear to President Putin that if he makes any more moves into Ukraine we will have severe sanctions,” Mr. Biden said. “We will increase our presence in Europe with NATO allies.”Meanwhile, Mr. Biden’s national security team on Friday turned their attention to preparation for the Geneva talks, set for January 9 and 10, to discuss the Russian massing of some 1,00,000 troops on its border with Ukraine.Mr. Biden is scheduled to speak by phone on Sunday with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday debriefed Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly, Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on the Biden-Putin call and discussed preparations for the upcoming summit.A top Putin aide on Friday reinforced that Russia stands by its demands for written security guarantees. Moscow wants it codified that any future expansion of NATO must exclude Ukraine and other former Soviet bloc countries and demands that the bloc remove offensive weaponry from countries in the Russian neighborhood.“We will not allow our initiatives to be drowned in endless discussions,” Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told the state RIA-Novosti news agency Friday.“If no constructive answer comes in a reasonable time and the West continues its aggressive course, Russia will have to take all necessary measures to maintain a strategic balance and remove unacceptable threats to our security,” he added.The Biden administration and NATO allies have made clear that the Russian demands are non-starters.Former envoys’ letterFollowing the Biden-Putin call, a group of 24 former U.S. national security officials and Russia experts — a group that includes several officials who served in the Obama, George W. Bush and Clinton’s administrations — released a statement calling on Mr. Biden to immediately, and publicly, lay out the penalties Russia would face if Mr. Putin were to move forward with military action.The Russians for their part continue to make the case that they are facing an existential threat with Ukraine.

Ukraine said on Saturday one of its soldiers was killed in fighting with pro-Moscow separatists, as the U.S. again warned Russia against any attacks on the country.In his New Year’s eve address, Mr. Zelensky said ending the war in the east remains his “main goal”.“One serviceman of the Joint Forces was fatally wounded,” the Army said in a statement.It also added that separatists had launched three attacks within 24 hours, using grenade launchers and small arms.The Army gave no further details of how the soldier was killed.Tensions with Moscow have soared in recent months, with Russia massing troops near Ukraine’s borders.The West has accused the Kremlin of planning an invasion.On December 22, international monitors said Russia and Ukraine had agreed to restore a ceasefire, but as early as the next day, Kiev and separatists accused each other of new violations. The soldier’s death on Saturday was the first since the truce was agreed.All previous ceasefires crumbled.Kiev has been battling a pro-Moscow insurgency in two breakaway regions bordering Russia since 2014, when the Kremlin annexed Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula.

There were no reports of casualties.Apart from a single incident in September, there has been no cross-border rocket fire since a cease-fire ended an 11-day war between Israel and Hamas in May.In a statement, the Israeli army said the rockets fell off the coast of the Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area.“According to protocol, no sirens were sounded and no interception took place,” it added.High tensionsWitnesses in Gaza said they woke up to the sound of outgoing missiles around 7 a.m. and pictures circulated on social media showed whiffs of white smoke from the launching area.The cease-fire, brokered by Egypt and other mediators, has been fragile. The militant Hamas group says Israel did not take serious steps to ease the blockade it imposed on Gaza.Tension are also high as other groups like the smaller but more hard-line Islamic Jihad threaten military escalation if Israel doesn’t end the administrative detention of a Palestinian prisoner who has been on a hunger strike for over 130 days.

China will end subsidies for electric and hybrid cars at the end of the year, authorities have announced, saying the strength of sales in the sector meant state support was no longer needed.In a statement published on Friday, the Ministry of Finance said purchase subsidies would be reduced by 30% from the beginning of 2022 before being scrapped completely by the end of the year.“Given the growth of the industry for vehicles with new energy, the sales trends and the smooth transition of manufacturers, the subsidies... will end on December 31,” the Ministry said.“Vehicles registered after December 31, 2022 will not be subsidised.”Sales of electric and hybrid cars have boomed in China, with increases of more than 100% year-on-year in recent months.The cars are set to represent 18% of all vehicle sales in 2022, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) estimated last week. In 2019, they accounted for only 5%.Of the 27.5 million vehicles set to be sold this year, according to CAAM, five million will be electric and hybrids.

If a majority of member states back it, it will become EU law, coming into effect from 2023.Opposing viewsFrance has led the charge for nuclear power — its main energy source — to be included, despite robust opposition from Austria and scepticism from Germany, which is in the process of shutting all its nuclear plants.Fossil-reliant countries in the EU’s east and south have also defended the use of natural gas, at least as a transitional source, even though it still produces significant greenhouse emissions.

 Maldives and China
on Saturday signed key bilateral agreements during Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s visit, on developing and maintaining infrastructure in the Indian Ocean archipelago, besides agreeing on a visa-free travel arrangement for Maldivians intending to travel to China.
Mr. Wang arrived in Male on Friday, as part of his five-nation trip to Eritrea, Kenya, the island nation of Comoros, the Maldives and Sri Lanka. Maldivian Foreign Minister Abdulla Shahid and his Chinese counterpart unveiled a special official logo to mark 50 years of diplomatic relations between the countries. “For the past five decades, China has been an important partner in the socio-economic development of the Maldives, contributing immensely towards social housing, capacity building, infrastructure development, and tourism. I have no doubt that Maldives-China relations will rise to new heights under the able leadership of both President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, and President Xi Jinping,” Mr. Shahid said, at a press conference.A statement issued by the Maldivian Foreign Ministry said the visa-waiver agreement would allow Maldivians to travel to China on 30-day visa free basis once the pandemic restrictions are lifted. The two governments signed an agreement of ‘Economic and Technical Cooperation’ on grant aid, focusing on social, livelihood, and infrastructure projects. Further, the Government of Maldives signed a ‘Letter of Exchange’ on a ‘Feasibility Study of Management and Maintenance of China-Maldives Friendship Bridge’, for Chinese assistance in maintaining the 1.4-km bridge connecting capital Male with the island of Hulhumale.It was built with $200 million Chinese assistance during the term of former President Abdulla Yameen, whose government was close to Beijing. The bridge is considered China’s flagship project in the Maldives. Male owes Beijing about $1.4 billion from past loans, which President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih’s government has sought to “restructure”.China also agreed to back a sea-water desalination project and cooperate in the health sector, the Foreign Ministry said. Minister Wang’s visit would be one of “great significance to the future development of our bilateral relations”, Chinese Ambassador in Male Wang Lixin said in a tweet.Mr. Wang’s visit will be watched closely by New Delhi, which has maintained frequent contact with the Solih government that openly pursues an ‘India First’ foreign policy. Following regime change in Male in 2018, New Delhi committed $1.4 billion to development in the island nation that is home to about 5.5 lakh people.Mr. Wang’s visit also coincides with a growing ‘India Out’ campaign among sections within the Maldives that oppose “Indian military presence” in the country.

At least 22 people, including 10 children, died in a popular mountain resort town in Pakistan after being stuck in their vehicles overnight during a heavy snowstorm as temperatures plummeted, officials said on Saturday.Most of the victims died of hypothermia, officials said. Among them was an Islamabad police officer and seven other members of his family, fellow police officer Atiq Ahmed said.More than 4 feet of snow fell in the area of the Murree Hills resort overnight Friday and early Saturday, trapping thousands of cars on roadways, said Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed. The snow was so severe that heavy equipment brought in to clear it initially got stuck during the night, said Umar Maqbool, assistant commissioner for the town of Murree. Temperatures fell to minus 8 degrees Celsius.Officials called in paramilitary troops and a special military mountain unit to help. By late Saturday, thousands of vehicles had been pulled from the snow but more than a thousand were still stuck, Ahmed said.Most roads leading to the area’s resorts were largely cleared of snow by late Saturday, and military troops were working to clear the rest, Mr. Maqbool said. The military also converted army-run schools into relief camps where they provided shelter and food for the tourists who had been rescued.Emergency officials distributed food and blankets to people while they were trapped in their snowed-in vehicles, but many died of hypothermia. Others may have died from carbon monoxide poisoning after running their car heaters for long periods of time, said rescue services physician Abdur Rehman. As of late Saturday, the death toll included 10 men, 10 children and two women, Mr. Rehman said.In one instance, a husband and wife and their two children all died in their car. In another, four young friends died together, he said.Located 46 km north of Islamabad, Murree is a popular resort town that attracts well over a million tourists annually. Streets leading into the town are often blocked by snow in winter.

"he United Nations said on Saturday it would hold talks in Sudan aimed at salvaging a fragile democratic transition amid a grinding stalemate following an October coup and the prime minister's resignation last week.Volker Perthes, the UN envoy for Sudan, said in a statement the UN-facilitated political process would seek a “sustainable path forward towards democracy and peace” in the country. It wasn’t immediately clear when discussions might begin.“It is time to end the violence and enter into a constructive process. This process will be inclusive,” he said.Mr. Perthes said key players in Sudan, including the military, rebel groups, political parties and protest movements will be invited to take part in the process as well as civil society and women’s groups.There was no immediate comment from the pro-democracy movement or the military on the UN statement.The October 25 coup scuttled hopes of a peaceful transition to democracy in Sudan more than two years after a popular uprising forced the military overthrow of longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir and his Islamist government in April 2019.Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok resigned from office on January 2 citing a failure to reach a compromise between the generals and the country’s pro-democracy movement. He had been ousted in the coup only to be reinstated a month later following a deal with the military meant to calm tensions and anti-coup protests.But Mr. Hamdok resigned, plunging the country further into turmoil amid political deadlock and relentless street protests that have claimed the lives of at least 60 people since the coup.Mr. Perthes said repeated violence since the coup has deepened the mistrust of the military among political parties. He warned that the deadlock could push the country into further instability and “squander the important political, social and economic gains” since the uprising against al-Bashir.The protest movement insists that a civilian government lead the transition, a demand rejected by the generals who say power will be handed over only to an elected government. Elections are planned in July 2023.

"everal high-profile Ethiopian Opposition figures were tasting freedom on Saturday after the government granted a surprise amnesty for prominent political detainees, including Tigrayan party leaders.The government said the move was designed to promote “national dialogue” and follows a dramatic shift in fortunes in the brutal 14-month war between forces loyal to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and the rebel Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF).TPLF fighters withdrew to their stronghold in the northernmost region of Tigray at the end of December in the face of a military offensive by government forces that saw them retake a string of strategic towns.Several TPLF figures were among those pardoned, as well as Opposition leaders from the Oromo ethnic group, the largest in Ethiopia, and the Amhara.“The key to lasting unity is dialogue. Ethiopia will make any sacrifices to this end,” the government communications service said in a statement late Friday announcing the amnesty.There has been something of a pause in fighting since the TPLF retreat, although the rebels accuse the government of still carrying out deadly drone strikes on Tigray.Among those freed were several politicians rounded up after deadly protests erupted in mid-2020 over the killing of Hachalu Hundessa, a popular Oromo singer and activist.They included Eskinder Nega, a veteran Amhara journalist. Others released were Jawar Mohammed, an Oromo media mogul.

China said on Saturday it would begin implementing a strategic agreement with Iran, strengthening economic and political cooperation between the two countries as Beijing blasted Washington’s sanctions on Tehran.China and Iran signed the agreement last year after years of talks, with the wide-ranging partnership set to span areas including energy, security, infrastructure and communications.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir-Abdollahian announced the start of the partnership’s implementation at a meeting in east China’s Wuxi on Friday, Beijing’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Few details of the secretive deal have been published, but the

reported in 2020 that it would secure a regular supply of oil for China, citing a draft of the agreement leaked to the paper.
China is Iran’s leading trade partner and was one of the biggest buyers of the country’s oil before then-U.S. president Donald Trump reimposed sweeping unilateral sanctions in 2018.China has officially stopped importing oil from Iran, but analysts say Iranian crude is continuing to enter the country disguised as imports from other countries.Mr. Wang told his Iranian counterpart Friday that China would continue to “oppose illegal unilateral sanctions against Iran,” the Foreign Ministry said.Vienna talks under wayBeijing has long sought to boost ties with Tehran, with Chinese president Xi Jinping describing Iran as “China’s major partner in the Middle East” on a rare visit to the country in 2016.Mr. Wang and Mr. Amir-Abdollahian’s meeting comes as talks continue in Vienna over a potential deal to halt Tehran’s development of nuclear weapons.A 2015 deal — agreed by Iran, the U.S., China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany — offered Tehran sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme.But the U.S. withdrew from the agreement in 2018, reimposing biting sanctions and prompting Tehran to begin rolling back on its commitments.Talk to salvage the nuclear deal began in late November, after being suspended when Iran elected a new ultraconservative government in June.Mr. Wang told his Iranian counterpart on Friday that China believes the United States is to blame for the current state of the deal, the foreign ministry said in its statement.

U.S. intelligence officials have determined a Russian effort is under way to create a pretext for its troops to further invade Ukraine, and Moscow has already prepositioned operatives to conduct “a false-flag operation” in eastern Ukraine, according to the White House.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Friday the intelligence findings show Russia is also laying the groundwork through a social media disinformation campaign that frames Ukraine as an aggressor that has been preparing an imminent attack against Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine.Ms. Psaki charged that Russia has already dispatched operatives trained in urban warfare who could use explosives to carry out acts of sabotage against Russia’s own proxy forces — blaming the acts on Ukraine — if Russian President Vladimir Putin decides he wants to move forward with an invasion.“We are concerned that the Russian government is preparing for an invasion in Ukraine that may result in widespread human rights violations and war crimes should diplomacy fail to meet their objectives,” Ms. Psaki said.Pentagon spokesman John Kirby described the intelligence as “very credible.” A U.S. official, who was not authorised to comment on the intelligence and spoke on condition of anonymity, said much of it was gleaned from intercepted communications and observations of the movements of people.The U.S. intelligence findings, which were declassified and shared with U.S. allies before being made public, estimate that a military invasion could begin between mid-January and mid-February.Ukraine is also monitoring the potential use of disinformation by Russia.The new U.S. intelligence was unveiled after a series of talks between Russia and the U.S. and its Western allies this week in Europe aimed at heading off the escalating crisis made little progress.White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan on ThursdayRussia is laying the groundwork to invade under false pretenses should Mr. Putin decide to go that route. He said the Russians have been planning “sabotage activities and information operations” that accuse Ukraine of prepping for its own imminent attack against Russian forces in eastern Ukraine.Crimean parallelsHe said this is similar to what the Kremlin did in the lead-up to Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea.Meanwhile the Russians, while maintaining they don’t plan to invade Ukraine, are demanding that the U.S. and NATO provide written guarantees that the alliance will not expand eastward.Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned on Friday that Moscow wouldn’t wait indefinitely for the Western response, saying he expects the U.S. and NATO to provide a written answer next week.

International aid came to a sudden halt and the U.S. has frozen $9.5 billion in Afghan central bank assets held overseas.Hunger now threatens 23 million Afghans, or 55% of the population, says the UN.The Oslo visit from Sunday to Tuesday will be focussed on human rights and humanitarian aid as a poverty crisis deepens in Afghanistan. The hardline Islamists will meet Norwegian authorities and officials from a number of allied countries including Britain, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy and the U.S., the Norwegian Foreign Ministry statement said.The delegation is also expected to meet Afghans from civil society, including women leaders and journalists.“These meetings do not represent a legitimisation or recognition of the Taliban” Norwegian Foreign Minister Anniken Huitfeldt said Friday. “But we must talk to the de facto authorities in the country.

Vietnamese monk-turned-peace-activist Thich Nhat Hanh, a hugely influential Buddhist credited with bringing mindfulness to the West, has died aged 95.The Zen master, whose reach within Buddhism is seen as second only to the Dalai Lama, spent nearly four decades in exile after being banished from his homeland for calling for an end to the Vietnam-American War.Thich Nhat Hanh “passed away peacefully” at the Tu Hieu Temple in the city of Hue, Vietnam’s Buddhist heartland, his Zen teaching organisation, the Plum Village Community of Engaged Buddhism, said.Before his return to Vietnam in 2018, he set up retreats around the world and wrote over 100 books including on mindfulness and meditation — a cornerstone of a $4.2 trillion global wellness industry espoused by Oprah Winfrey, Arianna Huffington and tech billionaire Marc Benioff.Born in 1926, Thich Nhat Hanh was ordained aged 16 and went on to found a youth school which trained volunteers to build clinics and infrastructure in villages blighted by war.In the early 1960s he travelled to the U.S., where he taught at Columbia and Princeton universities, but after one trip in 1966 to meet U.S. civil rights icon Martin Luther King — who joined his calls to end the Vietnam War — he was barred from returning home. Believing that war was fundamentally wrong, the monk refused to take sides in the conflict and was consequently persecuted by the governments of both North and South Vietnam.

".S. President Joe Biden is maintaining pressure on Russian leader Vladimir Putin over Ukraine after announcing a small troop deployment to eastern Europe even as top Pentagon officials backed a renewed push for diplomacy.As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged Western leaders to avoid stirring “panic” over the massive Russian troop buildup on his country’s borders, Mr. Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed on the need for de-escalation.Not ready to concedeNeither Mr. Putin nor his European and American counterparts had until now appeared ready to give ground in the weeks-long crisis, the worst in decades between Russia and the West.But according to a Macron aide, Mr. Putin told the French leader in a call lasting more than an hour that he had “no offensive plans.”In Washington, Mr. Biden nevertheless said on Friday he would soon send a small number of U.S. troops to bolster the NATO presence in eastern Europe as tensions remain heightened.The United States already has tens of thousands of troops stationed across mostly Western Europe.At the Pentagon, top officials urged a focus on diplomacy while saying that Russia now had enough troops and equipment in place to threaten the whole of Ukraine.Any such conflict, warned the top U.S. general, Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley, would be “horrific” for both sides.“If that was unleashed on Ukraine, it would be significant, very significant, and it would result in a significant amount of casualties,” Mr. Milley said.‘Still time for diplomacy’But speaking alongside Mr. Milley, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said there “is still time and space for diplomacy.“Mr Putin can do the right thing as well,” Mr. Austin said. “There is no reason that this situation has to devolve into conflict.”During his talks with Mr. Macron, Mr. Putin “expressed no offensive plans and said he wanted to continue the talks with France and our allies,” the aide to the French president said.Their conversation “enabled us to agree on the need for a de-escalation,” the aide told journalists.Mr. Putin “said very clearly that he did not want confrontation.”

"Dire straits: The biggest concern for students involve clinical subjects and learning surgery. File Photo

Two years on after thousands of Indian medical students saw their education in China abruptly put on hold amid the COVID-19 outbreak, students are still in the dark about when they can return and are growing increasingly desperate about their future. Students from half a dozen medical colleges in China, who have remained in India over the past two years, told
The Hindu
in interviews that they have been given no information about when they can return and that their online classes have left them unprepared as some face imminent graduation having missed out on practical training that is a crucial component of medical education.
 “Some of us are going to graduate with degrees that are only on paper, while we have wasted our family’s savings,” said one student enrolled in a college in Tianjin. The students
The Hindu
spoke to were all enrolled in the 45 universities authorised by China to offer MBBS degrees to foreign students taught in English. There are around 23,000 Indian medical students enrolled in Chinese programmes. The students interviewed are not being named as they were concerned about jeopardising their return to their universities.
In late January 2020, colleges across China closed amid the COVID-19 outbreak. Many students were in India during their winter holidays, and have remained in the country since. Others returned home as the outbreak spread, particularly those studying in Wuhan and in Hubei province, which is an important centre of medical teaching in China. India’s first confirmed COVID-19 case, on January 30, 2020, was a medical student from Kerala who returned from Wuhan.Online classesOver the past two years, students have had online classes which are used to teach theory, but clinical subjects remain untaught. Even a virtual theoretical education hasn’t been without hiccups. After the border crisis with China and the subsequent banning of 200 Chinese apps, students have to use sometimes unreliable virtual private network software to access apps where lectures are streamed. Most have to settle for subsequently downloading videos of lectures, which has meant little opportunity to interact with teachers.“We are slipping into depression,” said one student from Karnataka. “And I’m hearing this from all of my classmates. We face constant questioning from our family, who have helped us pay for this education, about how we are going to become doctors. It is a sense of humiliation for some of us, and we are just confining ourselves to our homes and have stopped socialising.”The biggest concern, students said, involved clinical subjects and learning surgery. The universities in China said they would restructure the curriculum to make up for the absence of practical learning when they return. But students who are graduating in the next two years are running out of time.“We have not even seen a cadaver,” said one student. “And the university’s plan, when we return to China, is for us to practice with a cadaver in the morning and then learn live surgeries in the evening. How is this even possible?”The question of returning to China itself remains uncertain two years into the pandemic. The universities say they have been given no timetable from the Chinese authorities on when they can issue letters needed for visa applications. Indian students have heard that some South Korean and Malaysian postgraduates have been given visas, but none so far from India. “The universities say it is not in their hands and the government has to give permission,” said one student.The students chose China to pursue their medical degrees after they were unable to either secure a highly competitive government seat in India or afford the exorbitant costs of a private education.Preferred destinationChina has gradually replaced Russia and Eastern Europe as a preferred destination, students said, because of a combination of factors: the costs, which vary across Chinese universities; the rapid improvement there in the quality of facilities; and the fact that a one-year internship, offered with the five-year degrees, is recognised in India.Students said those from China also generally fared better than many other foreign countries in clearing the challenging foreign medical graduate exam that foreign graduates are required to take, which in recent years has had a 15% pass rate.After two years of a challenging virtual education, the odds of passing that exam have only grown taller, while students still remain in the dark about when they may be able to return to their colleges and make up for the lost time.Asked about the plight of Indian students, the Chinese Foreign Ministry in November said the government “always attaches high importance to the issue of foreign students coming to China for their studies”.“On the basis of ensuring safety amid COVID-19, we will consider in a coordinated manner arrangement for allowing foreign students to return to China for their studies,” spokesperson Zhao Lijian said.That stand hasn’t changed, while China’s doors to the world still remain closed. For the students, a painful wait continues.

“When the Taliban offers you — a pregnant, unmarried woman — safe haven, you know your situation is messed up,” Ms. Bellis wrote in her column.New Zealand has managed to keep the spread of the virus to a minimum during the pandemic.But the nation’s requirement that even returning citizens spend 10 days isolating in quarantine hotels run by the military has led to a backlog of thousands of people wanting to return home vying for spots.She said she sent 59 documents to New Zealand authorities in Afghanistan but they rejected her application for an emergency return.Ms. Bellis said that pregnancy can be a death sentence in Afghanistan because of the poor state of maternity care and lack of surgical capabilities.

Hosting more than two dozen visiting world leaders in a banquet in Beijing on Saturday, China’s President Xi Jinping called for countries “to practice true multilateralism” and “uphold the international system centred on the United Nations”.Reading between the lines of the message, carefully couched in diplomatic language, was a thinly veiled criticism of the U.S., which China has accused, particularly in the wake of recently deteriorating relations, of practicing “hegemony” and undermining the UN-centred order. That message was conveyed recently in more explicit terms by the country’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who in his end-of-year review of China’s foreign policy contrasted Mr. Xi “pointing out unequivocally that there is but one international order, that is the international system with the UN at its core” with “a certain country’s interference in the internal affairs of other countries in the name of democracy and human rights, and the fabrication of false narratives of democracy versus authoritarianism”.The banquet for visiting leaders, which followed Friday’s opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics, was attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, five Central Asian Presidents, Singapore President Halimah Yacob, and Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan.The list of who wasn’t present was just as revealing. Ahead of the games, the U.S., U.K., Australia, Japan and Canada were among countries that announced a “diplomatic boycott” — their athletes are participating — citing China’s human rights violations in Xinjiang.India initially did not join the boycott and in November expressed support for the Games along with Russia following a meeting of the foreign ministers of Russia, India and China. That changed on Thursday when India said it would not send an official to attend the opening ceremony to protest China’s decision to select a PLA regiment commander involved in the June 15, 2020 Galwan Valley clash as one of the Olympic torchbearers.While China has hit out at the U.S. for “politicising” the Games, the event has at the same time offered for Beijing an important diplomatic platform, as Saturday’s banquet underlined, after two years of a pause in its diplomatic activity, which was limited to virtual engagements. Mr. Xi has not left China since mid-January 2020, when he visited Myanmar, and there have been no major incoming foreign visits until the Olympics this month. The Chinese state media highlighted that Mr. Putin was the first foreign leader to confirm his attendance at the Games, and the growing closeness in China-Russia ties has been in focus this week. On Friday, Mr. Xi and Mr. Putin in a lengthy joint statement that followed talks outlined a common position on a range of issues from human rights to attacking NATO’s “expansionism” in Europe and America’s Indo-Pacific strategy in Asia for having a “negative impact” on the region.

Myanmar villagers and anti-coup fighters have accused troops of burning hundreds of homes in the country’s restive northwest, as the junta seeks to crush resistance to its rule.Mass protests against last year’s coup have been met with a brutal military crackdown, and violence has flared across Myanmar as civilians form “people’s defence forces” (PDF) to oppose the junta.A woman from Bin village in the Sagaing region, which has seen recent clashes, said troops had arrived in the early hours of Monday.“They shelled artillery and fired guns before coming in,” she said on Friday, adding that the sound had sent villagers fleeing.Troops then set fire to around 200 houses, including her own, she said, requesting anonymity.“We could not bring anything with us.

The U.S. State Department is waiving sanctions on Iran’s civilian nuclear programme in a technical step necessary to return to the 2015 nuclear agreement, a senior official said on Friday.The resumption of the waiver, ended by the Donald Trump administration in 2020, “would be essential to ensuring Iran’s swift compliance” if a new deal on controlling Tehran’s nuclear programme can be reached in talks in Vienna, the State Department official said.The waiver allows other countries and companies to participate in Iran’s civilian nuclear programme without triggering U.S. sanctions on them, in the name of promoting safety and non-proliferation.The civilian programme includes Iran’s increasing stockpiles of enriched uranium.“Absent this sanctions waiver, detailed technical discussions with third parties regarding disposition of stockpiles and other activities of nonproliferation value cannot take place,” the official said, insisting on anonymity.The Vienna talks, which include Iran, the United States, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, are at a key stage where the parties have to make “critical political decisions,” a senior U.S. official said last week.“The technical discussions facilitated by the waiver are necessary in the final weeks of Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) talks,” the State Department official said on Friday.The U.S. official insisted that the move was not “part of a quid pro quo,” as the partners in the JCPOA talks await Iran’s response .Not a sweeping measureState Department spokesman Ned Price insisted this U.S. step is a sanctions waiver for the civilian nuclear programme and not broader sanctions relief.Mr. Price wrote on Twitter: “We did NOT provide sanctions relief for Iran and WILL NOT until/unless Tehran returns to its commitments under the JCPOA. We did precisely what the last Administration did: permit our international partners to address growing nuclear nonproliferation and safety risks in Iran.”

"Fun avenues: Rebecca Luo, left, with skiers on the slopes near Beijing. Special Arrangement
Arona Huang, like most Chinese parents, had football and tennis lessons on the weekend schedule for her child.But the destination of choice now for her son Aaron, who is six, is the ski slopes in Beijing’s suburbs, one of dozens that have sprouted in the past five years as China prepared for the Winter Olympic Games, which began on Friday.When Beijing won the bid in 2015, the Chinese government saw both a pride project — securing the distinction of becoming the first city to host both the summer and winter games — and a massive sporting and commercial opportunity.China has never been a winter sport nation. In the past six years, however, there has been a more than 300% increase in the number of skating rinks. The country has in this time also added more than 250 new ski resorts, with the total number now crossing 800.Ms. Huang said skiing was previously the preserve of the rich, given the few options in China and the preference of the wealthy to usually head to Europe. That has now changed.After companies such as the firm where she works began organising annual retreats in ski — and not the usual beach — resorts, she enrolled her child in skiing winter camps. “A day on the slopes,” she said, “is now not much more than buying two tickets to see the Forbidden City”, costing a little over 100 Yuan (around Rs. 1,000) if you have your own equipment.During the COVID-19 pandemic, as China shut its doors to the world — which are still yet to open two years later with stringent travel restrictions — the usual huge outflow of international tourism was instead directed inwards. Among the service industries that capitalised the most, according to tourism data, were ski resorts, with more than 300 million trips in 2021-22 related to winter sports.China’s cold northeast, which receives plenty of snowfall, is home to many of the resorts. But closer to the arid capital, artificial snow is being used in towns like Chongli, which is hosting many of the events this month. Unlike for recreational activities which do not require heavy snowfall, there are strict standards and density requirements for the Olympics. Man-made snow had to be used in the previous two games in South Korea and Russia as well.That has triggered a debate about the environmental impact, with reports estimating that 49 million gallons of water will be used in a part of the country that suffers from water shortages.Organisers point out that is only a small fraction of daily water consumption in Beijing, accounting for less than 2% of the usage in Yanqing district, which is hosting events. In Chongli, the water demand for the games will account for a higher 10% of the normal usage. To mitigate that consumption, conduits have been built in Yanqing to direct the snowmelt to reservoirs, along with a new sewage treatment plant. That is less of a problem in the country’s northeast, in provinces like Jilin, or in Xinjiang in the far west, which is also on a resort-building spree, that receive heavy snow.Novelty and thrillsPart of the attraction for a new generation of winter sports enthusiasts is both the novelty of a new experience and the thrills involved, even if the expenses are higher, albeit decreasing, with the surfeit of new venues. “You have to overcome strong fear when pushing yourself to go down steeper slopes,” said Rebecca Luo, a national certified ski instructor. “But if you do, you find fulfillment.”She said this winter was the busiest by far of the past five seasons she has seen on the country’s slopes. But even after the glare of the Olympics subsides, skiers expect the crowds aren’t likely to thin. At least, that is what China’s latest booming industry is betting on.

Western leaders on Saturday said Russia and China were seeking to “replace the existing international rules” with their own order, as Beijing backed Moscow over its showdown with NATO.Russia has all but encircled Ukraine with its huge troop buildup and U.S. President Joe Biden has warned that Vladimir Putin plans an invasion within days.Moscow is using the threat to invade Ukraine to demand a halt to NATO expansion and what it calls “Cold War” ideologies.At a closely choreographed appearance in Beijing for the Winter Olympics, Mr. Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping had put up a united front against NATO expansion.“For the first time we now see Beijing joining Moscow in calling on NATO to stop admitting new members,” noted the alliance’s chief Jens Stoltenberg, speaking at the Munich Security Conference.‘Authoritarian model’“It is an attempt to control the fate of free nations, to rewrite the international rulebook and impose their own authoritarian models of governance,” he warned.EU chief Ursula von der Leyen had stronger words, accusing Moscow of a “blatant attempt” to rewrite the global order.Russia and China are seeking to “replace the existing international rules — they prefer the rule of the strongest to the rule of law, intimidation instead of self-determination,” she told the Munich conference.China has in recent years been in the crosshairs of the West over its human rights record, including its alleged abuse of Uighurs, which has also sparked a U.S.-led Western diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics.Speaking in Munich on Saturday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz warned against viewing the world through Cold War lenses, as he assessed that nations are no longer divided into a communist and a capitalist half since the 1990s.“There are now only capitalist countries on the globe, but North Korea. And if you see it like this, the difference between the states is about autocracy, about the way how we rule our countries, about democracy,” he said.“It is absolutely clear that we are going into a world that is multi-polar,” he said, adding that “you can be sure that other upcoming or already great nations of Asia will not accept” any attempts by China or Russia to build up their own spheres of domination or interest.“Not Korea, not Japan, not Vietnam, not Indonesia, not Malaysia,” he warned.

The chances of reviving the Iran nuclear accord are dwindling and the “moment of truth” has arrived for Tehran’s leadership, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Saturday.“We now have the chance to reach an agreement that will allow sanctions to be lifted. But if we do not succeed very quickly, the negotiations risk failing,” Mr. Scholz told the Munich Security Conference.“The Iranian leadership has a choice. Now is the moment of truth.”The 2015 Iran nuclear agreement had offered Tehran sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme, but the U.S. unilaterally withdrew in 2018.This in turn prompted Iran to start ramping up its nuclear activities.The outline of a new deal appears to be on the table in talks which have been held in Vienna since late November between signatories Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia — and the United States indirectly.A U.S. State Department spokesperson told
AFP on Thursday that “substantial progress has been made in the last week”.“If Iran shows seriousness, we can and should reach an understanding on mutual return to full implementation of the JCPOA within days,” the spokesperson said, using an acronym for the 2015 deal.But “anything much beyond that would put the possibility of return to the deal at grave risk,” the spokesperson added.Experts believe Iran is only a few weeks away from having enough fissile material to build a nuclear weapon — even if it would take several more complicated steps to create an actual bomb.",1,0,0,0
"Rare forte:For Vivek Mahbubani, humour has become a self-defence mechanism.Special Arrangement
One of stand-up comedian Vivek Mahbubani’s favourite bits in his routine is the one where he has an encounter with a Hong Kong policeman.He recalls how, in an experience that is sadly all-too-familiar for Hong Kong’s minorities, he is stopped yet again for a “random” search on the street. One cop mangles the pronunciation of his name as he checks his ID. As soon as they discover he isn’t foreigner but a Hongkonger fluent in Cantonese, the second cop immediately tries to recruit him, seeing a useful asset in “community outreach”.Beneath this seemingly simple tale is a layered and withering criticism of the discrimination that is rife in Hong Kong, an open secret that most of the majority is somehow oblivious of, yet is part of life for minorities.Most of Hong Kong’s 40,000-plus South Asians will have some story to tell of everyday indignities that they have become inured to, from being routinely stopped at the lobbies of their workplaces or apartments – the assumption is a South Asian entering a building is usually a deliveryman and couldn’t possibly be residing there – to hearing comments passed in Cantonese with the wrong assumption that a “foreigner” couldn’t understand the language.Then there are the “random” stops on the street.If it is an open secret, it is still a secret: discrimination faced by minorities, from South Asians to the many foreign domestic helpers many of whom come from the Philippines and Indonesia, remains rife, but a subject still remains on the margins.Mr. Mahbubani wants to change that. The experience of Indian-Hongkongers is a central theme in many of his routines, which he performs in both Cantonese and English.Born in Hong Kong to a mother from Mumbai and father from Kolkata, Mr. Mahbubani went to a local Chinese school. That gave him fluency in Cantonese, but also an acute sense of his identity and the complications that came with it.“In my whole year, there were maybe three non-Chinese,” he said. “I remember in my first year, another kid raised his hand and asked the teacher, ‘Why is there an alien in our class?’”Humour, he said, became a “self-defence mechanism”. He would respond to stereotypes with jokes.Growing up, his favourite comedians were American stand-ups Jerry Seinfeld and Chris Rock. In university in Hong Kong, Mr. Mahbubani started making notes for a career in stand-up that he thought would remain a a pipe-dream. Everyday life in Hong Kong, and his experience of being a minority, offered no shortage of material. “What speaking Cantonese gave me,” he said, “was that I got to enjoy Hong Kong from a very local point of view, some things foreigners might not get to see, while still not being Chinese. It is like living in two worlds.”A window to societyHe joked that “playing the dumb foreigner” can, on occasion, help – “if you’re caught jaywalking, for instance” — or offer a window to society, such as the instance where a bus-driver was taunting him with insults in Cantonese and then received the shock of his life when, getting off the bus, Mr. Mahbubani thanked him for the ride fluently.At a comedy competition in 2007, he dipped his toes in the waters of stand-up. He ended up winning the Cantonese competition (he won the English competition the following year). More gigs followed, as he juggled his job as a web developer with a passion for comedy, which is now his full-time occupation.Language, he said, has been the key “to breaking down the barrier”. “I joke that in Hong Kong, there are two ways to break the barrier. One, speak the language. Two, help people make money. You help people make money in Hong Kong, and they don’t care what colour your skin is.”Fifteen years on, Mr. Mahbubani feels there is more reflection on stereotypes that were once deeply ingrained. Yet, as the COVID-19 pandemic showed, there is far to go. Last year, a senior official in the Centre for Health Protection caused outrage after blaming South Asians for spreading COVID-19, prompting Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam to say “there is absolutely no suggestion of the spread of disease relating to race or ethnicity.”“What I hope to do,” Mr. Mahbubani said, “is that at the end of the evening after my set, a lot of the audience will hopefully leave with a different idea. I think they enjoy that I say out loud stuff they may have been thinking, but then joke about how ridiculous some of it is.”And all of this is done with a light touch — his aim isn’t to lecture. “For instance,” he said, “I joke about how people don’t sit next to me on the bus. And I say, ‘Do you guys think this is a bad thing? I love it. Please don’t sit next to me. I love the extra space, you know. ”

"thiopia will start generating power from its mega-dam on the Blue Nile on Sunday, government officials told
AFP , a major milestone for the controversial project.The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), set to be the largest hydroelectric scheme in Africa, has been at the centre of a regional dispute ever since Ethiopia broke ground there in 2011.“Tomorrow will be the first energy generation of the dam,” an Ethiopian government official said on Saturday.A second official confirmed the information. Both spoke on condition of anonymity because the development has not been officially announced.Downstream concernsEthiopia’s downstream neighbours Egypt and Sudan view the dam as a threat because of their dependence on Nile waters, while Addis Ababa deems it essential for its electrification and development.There was no immediate response from Cairo or Khartoum, which have been pressing Ethiopia to sign a binding agreement on the filling and operation of the dam ever since work first started.The three governments have held multiple rounds of talks. but so far there has been no sign of any breakthrough.The $4.2-billion (3.7-billion-euro) project is ultimately expected to produce more than 5,000 megawatts of electricity, more than doubling Ethiopia’s electricity output.

"olice aggressively pushed back protesters in Canada’s besieged capital on Saturday, seizing trucks and finally retaking control of the streets in front of the country’s Parliament buildings. Scores of trucks left under the increasing pressure, raising authorities’ hopes for an end to the three-week protest against the country’s COVID-19 restrictions and the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.The street in front of Parliament Hill, the collection of government offices that includes the Parliament buildings, was the heart of the protests.“They are trying to push us all away,” said one protester, Jeremy Glass of Shelburne, Ontario, as authorities forced the crowds to move further from the Parliament building. “The main camp is seized now. We’re no longer in possession of it.”Canadian authorities also announced they had used emergency powers to seize 76 bank accounts connected to protesters, totaling roughly $3.2 million ($2.5 million U.S.).On Saturday, they also closed a bridge into the nation’s capital from Quebec to prevent a renewed influx of protesters.Police said protesters remained aggressive, and pepper spray had been used to protect officers.Around midday, protest organisers said they had ordered truckers to move away from Parliament Hill.“To move the trucks will require time,” organisers said. “We hope that (police) will show restraint.”

The Australian Defence Department said that a Chinese Navy ship fired a laser at one of its surveillance aircraft, putting the lives of the crew in danger.The incident happened on Thursday when the P-8A Poseidon plane detected a laser illuminating the aircraft while in flight over Australia’s northern approaches, the Department said.Such episodes are not uncommon as the U.S. and its allies accuse China of asserting its military might, and have taken steps to challenge Beijing’s growing clout in the western Pacific and elsewhere.The Department said in a statement on Saturday that the laser came from a People’s Liberation Army Navy vessel. It was accompanying another Chinese ship that transited through the Torres Strait. Both ships were now in the Coral Sea, east of Australia, it said.“Illumination of the aircraft by the Chinese vessel is a serious safety incident,” the Defense Department said.Lasers present a serious problem because when aimed at aircraft they can injure pilots or temporarily blind them — which can present safety risks particularly as they are taking off and landing.Past accusationsTwo years ago, the U.S. also accused the Chinese navy of firing a laser at one if its Poseidon planes over the Pacific. China denied it, saying the plane had circled at low altitude over its warship despite repeated warnings.In 2019, Australian navy helicopter pilots reported being were hit by lasers while exercising in the South China Sea, forcing them to land as a precaution.Tensions have ratcheted up particularly in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims almost in its entirety, while the U.S. and its allies insist on freedom of navigation in international waters.

"Predators:Shami and Bumrah are a study in contrast. While the former is a skiddy customer, the latter’s bounce is steepling.File Photo 
| Photo Credit: QUINN ROONEY
These are glory days for Indian pace bowling.The sight of Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami running in and tormenting the batsmen is one for eternity.This pace pack hunts down batters with ruthless efficiency. The execution of plans is clinical.As India eyes a historic maiden Test series win on the South African soil, the focus will be on its rampaging pacemen. India now has plenty of gunpowder. It can blow away line-ups.As pace predators, Bumrah and Shami are a study in contrast, compounding batsmen’s woes.Deceptive actionBumrah is tall, has a unique high-arm action. His load-up is so much away from the body that it is incredible his arm is stretched fully and is straight and high as he delivers the ball. The bounce he gets is natural.And for a long-lever bowler, he has a deceptively, whippy, quick-arm action that generates speed. His victims pick his action a fraction late; by then the damage is done.In the Centurion Test, brushing away an ankle niggle, Bumrah showcased his full repertoire.He had castled Rassie van der Dussen with a delivery that came in sharply from outside off, and also took the ball away sharply from the off-stump. And he had the yorker ready — bowling incisive yorkers is a lot about understanding your release point — for night-watchman Keshav Maharaj.The intelligent Bumrah has compelling pace variations, alters the angles. The manner in which he trapped a battling Dean Elgar leg-before on the final day of the first Test is a case in point.The role of India’s previous bowling coach Bharat Arun in Bumrah’s development has been significant.Returning to the land where he made his Test debut in 2018. Bumrah has 106 wickets from 25 Tests at 22.33 (strike rate 50.5). In 2021, Bumrah had 30 scalps from nine Tests at 26.53 (SR 61.7).Shami’s methods are different. Firstly, he is much shorter than Bumrah and his arm is not as high at the point of release. If Bumrah’s bounce is steepling, Shami is a skiddy customer.Shami’s seam position is exemplary and his ability to seam the ball both ways from an off-stump line makes him dangerous.With Shami, you get speed, precision and two-way movement. Once he finds his rhythm, he can be a handful. He can reverse-swing the ball capably, too.Not for nothing does he have 203 wickets from 55 Tests at 27.00 (SR 49.2). He finished 2021 with 23 scalps from five Tests at 22.47 (SR 43.4).Both Bumrah and Shami can be a distinct threat to the southpaws as well, adeptly switching angles. And both are accurate with their length and line. They can also mix up their length to disrupt batsmen’s footwork.The supporting castThe lively Mohammed Siraj has a beautiful away-swinger and a potent in-dipper. He is a capable support seamer with 36 wickets from 11 Tests at 27.94 (SR 54.8).And Shardul Thakur (16 wickets, five Tests, at 23.75, SR 41.17) can provide crucial breakthroughs with bounce and subtle movement.And to think that Ishant Sharma (311 Test wickets) and Umesh Yadav (156 scalps) are sitting out. These are truly glory days for Indian pace bowling.

Chennaiyin FC will hope to have a better fortune in 2022 when it takes on Jamshedpur FC at GMC Athletic Stadium in Bambolim on Sunday after ending the previous year with three losses in its last four matches.The two-time champion has had a terrible run with heavy losses against Kerala Blasters FC and Bengaluru FC in its last two matches.The team’s strength in the initial set of matches was a compact defence and it did not concede too many goals even though it struggled to score frequently.However, in the last few matches the defence has been brutally exposed against quality sides and combined with lack of attacking firepower, the team has been caught on the backfoot.Goalkeeper Vishal Kaith has also struggled in front of the goal and the team paid the price for his errors in the last match against Bengaluru FC. Coach Bozidar Bandovic on Saturday hinted that there might be a change of custodian on Sunday.One positive news for CFC is the signing of striker Nerijus Valskis from Jamshedpur FC on free transfer. The Lithuanian is expected to add teeth to CFC’s attacking front after Rafael Crivellaro was ruled out for the rest of the season. Valskis, however, won’t be available for Sunday’s fixture.Jamshedpur FC has had two draws in the last two matches and will hope to take advantage of CFC’s weak defence and pick up full points.“Everybody would accept that Jamshedpur has done really well and deserve more points on the board. What we have to do is focus on the remaining games and make sure we keep ourselves in those top spots,” said JFC coach Owen Coyle.

Rodri scored a 93rd-minute winner as Manchester City took another huge step towards retaining the Premier League title with a 2-1 win over 10-man Arsenal on Saturday.Pep Guardiola's men are now 11 points clear at the top, thanks to an 11-game winning run, but were made to toil until deep into stoppage time by the Gunners.A 5-0 thrashing to City when the sides last met in August saw Arsenal off to its worst start to a league season in 67 years. But Mikel Arteta’s men have rallied to rise to fourth in the table and showed why as they led at half-time through Bukayo Saka's seventh goal of the season.Riyad Mahrez levelled from the penalty spot before Gabriel got himself sent off for two quick bookings just before the hour mark. And the 10 men just failed to hold out for a point when Rodri poked home from close range after Aymeric Laporte’s shot was blocked.Plastic bottles rained down on the Spanish international as he celebrated, the Arsenal supporters furious as they voiced their frustration at the officiating after seeing a penalty appeal of their own waived away in the first half.Arteta was forced to watch the game from home after he tested positive for coronavirus for the second time earlier this week. However, that did not disrupt the Gunners’ fine form. With Arteta’s assistant Albert Stuivenberg directing operations, the Gunners ran the champions and runaway leaders ragged in the first half.

They called him Zulu, one from the warrior clan. On the field, he was very much that, whether hustling the batsmen with speed or dismissing the ball to the distant corners.Beginning his career as a tearaway quick who could leave the batters with bruised limbs and dented egos, Lance Klusener, after injuries, bowled effective cutters.With the bat, he was a destroyer and a game changer. A true blue all-rounder, Klusener, now 50, was. Talking to
The Hindu
, Klusener felt the present South African team was going through a cycle. “It’s cyclical, there are times when you are on top, and then you rebuild. Big players have retired. Not easy to fill their shoes.”
Klusener added: “Two years from now, when this South African team has more experience, it could be a very different side.”Heavy workloadAsked why there were only a few genuine pace bowling all-rounders in Test cricket presently, Klusener replied, “the cricketers have to play three formats now and the workload can be heavy. Probably that’s the reason.”Queried about the present-day pace bowling all-rounders he admired, Klusener said, “Ben Stokes and Hardik Pandya, if he can be free of injuries and bowl with pace.”Kallis, the bestKlusener played in the era of exceptional pace bowling all-rounders. Asked who was the best, he observed, “Jacques Kallis without a doubt. He was an astonishing batter and a skilful bowler with pace.”And who was the big-hitter the explosive Klusener admired the most? The South African answered, “M.S. Dhoni hit the ball hard. Probably he is not the hardest hitter of them all but I liked the way he handled a chase, taking the game deep, running swiftly between the wickets, and launching into the big blows at just the right time.”Klusener added, “it takes a lot of skill to do that.”Sadly, Klusener was part of a moment that would haunt South African cricket forever.He stroked one down the ground and set off for the winning run in the 1999 World Cup semifinal against Australia and made his ground, only to see last man Allan Donald, ball watching, dropping his bat and being run-out at the wicket-keeper’s end in a tense, emotion-filled climax.“I want to forget that. We have not had the luck too in ICC tournaments. We have been on the wrong side of the weather, lost out on run-rates. We need to win one ICC event to get the monkey off our back,” Klusener said.Talent in AfghanistanHe resigned as the Afghanistan head coach recently after taking up the job in 2019. “There is amazing talent there, and if there is consistency in selection, there will be consistency in performances.”Klusener is open to the job of coaching an IPL team. “I would love that challenge.”The Zulu has more to offer to the game.Probably Dhoni is not the hardesthitter of them all but I liked the way he handled a chase

"n the wake of the England’s disastrous Ashes campaign in Australia, former captain Michael Atherton feels the English cricketers should not miss international duty to play in the IPL. “Players should not miss international duty to play in the IPL, nor be rested and rotated to allow them to play elsewhere. The carry-on during the winter, and at the start of the English summer, should not happen again,” Atherton wrote in his column for
The Times
.
The former captain also had other suggestions to help improve England’s performance in the international arena’s red-ball format.“The leading multi-format players are paid seven-figure sums, but, incredibly, the ECB washes its hands of them for two months of the year during the Indian Premier League.“The players should be told that, while the ECB will be accommodating of the request to play in the IPL, a 12-month contract is exactly that, and the granting of a no-objection certificate to play in the IPL and other franchised competitions is contingent on it being in the best interests of the England team,” Atherton said.“There have been so many errors here, from selection to strategy, that the captain has to bear personal responsibility. This could have been a much closer series had Root got things right on the field,” Atherton wrote.

New Zealand batsman Devon Conway continued his phenomenal rise in Test cricket, scoring 122 as New Zealand finished day one of the first Test against Bangladesh in a strong position here on Saturday.In only his fourth Test, and first since recovering from a broken hand, Conway lifted New Zealand, asked to bat, from one for one to close the day at 258 for five with Henry Nicholls on 32 and Tom Blundell out off the last ball for 11.“It’s a very special feeling,” Conway said of scoring a century in his first home Test and being in partnership with New Zealand icon Ross Taylor when he reached triple figures.It is the fourth time in seven Test innings that Conway has passed the 50-mark, and it lifted his average to 71.57. But after setting New Zealand up for a big score he gave his wicket away to an innocuous Mominul Haque delivery.

Aman Dahiya’s dream of playing in the Australian Open junior tennis event in Melbourne could not materialise owing to strict vaccination rules.“We have got the visa for Aman, but the Australian Open officials have been very firm in sticking to their stipulation. We did explain that under-18 vaccination had not yet started in India. We were also thinking of getting the vaccination done in some other country, but nothing worked out,” said coach Jignesh Rawal, who trains Aman at the Altevol Academy in Ahmedabad.The 17-year-old Aman, ranked 142 in the world among juniors, was scheduled to compete in the qualifying event of the Australian Open. Before that, he was also scheduled to play a grade-1 junior event at Traralgon in Australia.“You will not be allowed to play the Australian Open junior championships or J1 Traralgon events if you are not fully vaccinated,” wrote Francis Soyer from Tennis Australia.An exemption was sought for Aman, but after consultation with the “independent expert medical panel”, the organisers denied the same. “Under current Australian guidelines, the applicant would be considered eligible for vaccination and therefore does not qualify for exemption,” said the communication from Australia.Rawal said that the focus would now be to prepare Aman for the French Open in May, by which time the vaccination process would have also been completed.“Aman will play the two grade-2 junior events in Delhi and Kolkata.

All Kerala Blasters needs to catch up with Mumbai City at the top of the ISL table is a win on Sunday. Ivan Vukomanovic’s boys will not be short of motivation when they take on FC Goa at Vasco’s Tilak Maidan Stadium.They are now placed fifth with 13 points. But if they could take three points off Goa, they will draw level with Mumbai (16).They should be feeling they could do it. They are in form. They may have had to settle for a 1-1 draw in their last match, against Jamshedpur, but that was preceded by 3-0 wins against Chennaiyin and Mumbai.With the talented Sahal Samad finally starting to convert his promise into goals and Adrian Luna, Alvaro Vazquez and Jorge Peryera Diaz all looking in good nick, the Blasters could threaten any defence. And defence hasn’t exactly been Goa’s strength of late. The Goans will want to put behind them their disappointing effort against ATK Mohun Bagan in their last game. They had lost 1-2. It was Derrick Pereira’s third game since he took over as coach, after Juan Ferrando left for ATK Mohun Bagan.Pereira had begun with a draw, against Odisha. After the loss to ATK Mohun Bagan, he would be looking for a win.Goa – on eight points from as many games —needs a win to come out of the bottom half; it is lying ninth in the 11-team league.

"e are in the beautiful wind-swept city of sea and mountains. The rhythmic beating of the drums on the beach reflects the mood here.And the picturesque Newlands, which has the formidable Table Mountain as its backdrop, is among the great venues in cricket.India and South Africa will clash here in the decider of this fascinating Test series from January 11.The Indian bowling will have to pick itself up and coach Rahul Dravid is sure to crack the whip. He will have strong words for the batters too about building on starts and shot selection.As Dravid pointed out, the timing of a stroke, at what stage to play it, is vital.It will be hard for someone like Rishabh Pant to rein in his natural instincts. But the southpaw, with loads of natural talent, needs to apply himself for the team.Two senior batters, Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane, had departed after a long partnership and Pant needed to lock one end up and bide his time at the Wanderers.Instead, he succumbed to the mind games in the cauldron. Was he ‘softened’ up by Kagiso Rabada’s vicious lifter that struck him on the helmet grill?Then before the next delivery was bowled, there was chirping from Rassie van der Dussen from short-leg.HistoryThe two have a history. After all, Pant diving forward, almost certainly took van der Dussen’s edge off the ground, something that left the South Africans angry.Perhaps the words from van der Dussen infuriated Pant into playing a wild heave.Or did the wicketkeeper-batter not back himself to bat through the hostile spell from Rabada with the threat of physical damage.At least Pant did not, like the former India and Delhi all-rounder Madan Lal, back away to the leg side when the super quick Jeff Thomson bowled at him in Australia. To be fair to Madan, it was the pre-helmet era.Dravid is sure to have a conversation with Pant. You need to balance aggression with responsible batting and a workable defence has to be a part of your game.Washington Sundar was shaping well for India in Tests - he is a strong back-foot player who made runs in Australia with all the grace and flow of a left-hander.It’s a pity the southpaw had to be left out of the Test team owing to fitness concerns.Washington averages a whopping 66.25 with three half-centuries in four Tests, the highest being 96 not out, apart from being a handy off-spinner.Young cricketers like him, with such an outstanding record, should not be forgotten and lost to Test cricket.Pant is the lone left-hander in the line-up and India needs more of this breed to disrupt opposition’s bowling line.The South Africans countered K.L. Rahul’s ploy of leaving deliveries outside off by bowling a lot closer to the off-stump and making him play.More right-left combinations in the mix can change the dynamics of a contest, upset game-plans.Hanuma Vihari, someone who respects and learns from the game, bats for his team with a solid back-foot game and has the heart to bat in crisis, was a gain for India from the Wanderers",0,0,1,0

"espite problems on several fronts, the Proteas continue to churn out exceptional pacemen. The assembly line never dries out.In recent times, the fast and furious Anrich Nortje and, now, beanpole left-armer Marco Jansen have emerged.Paradoxically, had Nortje been fit for the series, we might have not seen Jansen at all. In fact, had Duanne Olivier not suffered from Covid after-effects, Jansen would not have made his Test debut at Centurion.Destiny’s childSo, in several respects, Jansen’s destiny’s child.The talent in the left-armer was recognised early. He was among those who bowled at the Indians in the nets during the 2018 tour.His bowling left Virat Kohli impressed. He bowled at the Royal Challengers Bangalore nets but was eventually bought by the Mumbai Indians.Jansen makes great use of his height with a high-arm action. He has a lovely side-on release, bowls from close to the stumps and brings with him the left-armer’s angle.He generates good pace, achieves natural bounce, has an effective short ball and moves the sphere. He is a potent package.Importantly, he can bring the ball into the right hander from over the wicket and take it away from the left-hander.In fact, Jansen reminds one of Bruce Reid, the tall Australian left-armer who bowled in the 80s and early 90s. He picked up 113 wickets in just 27 Tests.Jansen came into his own in the second innings at Centurion. He pitched the ball up and moved it away from Kohli who perished to a cover-drive.Jansen finished with four for 55. Skipper Dean Elgar called him the “Player-of-the-match for us”.He caught the eye at the Wanderers too. K.L. Rahul had just reached 50 when Jansen scalped him on the pull. Hooking, pulling or slashing Jansen is hazardous since the ball comes at varying heights.And he took out Mayank Agarwal on the drive, angling the ball across the right-hander and pitching it up.The free-stroking R. Ashwin fell to a slash off a short ball — once again it was a case of varying bounce — and Jansen dismissed Rishabh Pant with a delivery that came in with the angle and held its line on the left-hander’s off-stump.And he bowled close to Rahul’s off-stump to have the key batsman held in the cordon in the second innings.Jansen is versatile, can bowl from round the wicket too but needs to work on control.South Africa does not have a great history of left-arm quicks. Brett Shultz was fast but fitness concerns terminated his career.Jansen, who needs to put a lid on his temper, could lend the Proteas attack variety ",0,0,1,0
"ick Kyrgios on Saturday warned that Novak Djokovic would be unstoppable at the Australian Open if cleared to play, predicting the World No. 1 would use his predicament as fuel to win another Grand Slam title.The Serbian superstar was set to spend the weekend in a Melbourne immigration detention facility pending an appeal after he was dramatically refused entry to Australia over his COVID-19 vaccine status.Kyrgios has feuded with Djokovic in the past over his response to the coronavirus pandemic, but has softened his stance, saying on Saturday he was “feeling for him”.Djokovic’s visa was revoked after he failed to meet the country’s tough pandemic restrictions, with a court challenge to overturn his visa cancellation set to be heard on Monday.If successful, he will be gunning for a 10th Australian Open crown and a record 21st Grand Slam title — a milestone that Spanish great Rafael Nadal is also chasing at Melbourne Park.Fellow 20-time Grand Slam winner Roger Federer is injured and not in Australia.“If he’s allowed to play the Australian Open, I don’t want any bar of him. I reckon he’s going to be pissed off,” Kyrgios said in Sydney ahead of a warm-up tournament before the Australian Open on January 17.Added fuel“He’s going to be very determined to play well, and stick it to everyone (because) of what’s going on. I think this is just all added fuel for him, in my opinion.”“We all know how good of a competitor he is,” he added.“You don’t become a great champion like that without being able to overcome some adversity like this. I’m sure he’s overcome a lot more challenging times than, you know, spending a couple more extra days in hotel rooms.”Kyrgios on Friday called Australia’s treatment of the Serbian “really bad” and doubled down Saturday, saying it was “not really humane, is it, what’s going on”.“I think like it’s just, if this was a normal person they wouldn’t have to deal with all this. His life’s probably hard enough as it is, and I know what that’s like. I just hope it all gets sorted soon.”

They have lost just one game each, less than all other teams.And that sole defeat came in their opening matches for both. That means neither side has lost in its last eight games. It would indeed be interesting to find out what happens when these two in-form sides come face to face on Sunday at Vasco.Hyderabad is placed second in the table with 16 points, just one behind the leader and defending champion Mumbai City.

"Done with it: Kohli’s tenure at the helm in Tests had some memorable successes, but the end was disappointing. AP

The signs were there. Virat Kohli was becoming extremely frustrated with captaincy. The manner in which he kicked the air and blew up after Dean Elgar won a review on day three of the decider here indicated he was running out of patience.If he had a vision then behaving badly on the field of play was not a part of it. A day after India lost the series 2-1 to South Africa, Kohli
resigned as the Test captain, in a long tweet, here on Saturday.
The Delhi batsman, who took over captaincy in a rather dramatic fashion when M.S. Dhoni shocked everyone by stepping down as skipper after the Melbourne Test against Australia in 2014, formed a lasting relationship with coach Ravi Shastri.High and lowHis greatest achievement as captain was in leading India to its first ever Test series triumph in Australia. Passionate about Tests, the failure to beat South Africa in a Test series on this tour would go down among his greatest disappointments.During his stint as captain, Kohli did not see eye-to-eye with Anil Kumble, which led to the legend being forced out as coach. Kohli also did not lead India to a title triumph in any ICC competition. Being removed as the ODI captain hurt Kohli. And his public disagreement with the BCCI did not help matters either.The writing was on the wall. Rohit Sharma will be a natural successor to Kohli.Kohli said in his tweet, “It has been 7 years of hard work, toil and relentless perseverance everyday to take the team in the right direction. I’ve done the job with absolute honesty and left nothing out there. Everything has to come to a halt at some stage and for me as Test captain of India, it is now. There have been many ups and also some downs along the journey: but never had there been a lack of effort or a lack of belief.”He added, “I have always believed in giving my 120 percent in everything I do, and if I can’t do that, I know it is not the right thing to do. I have absolute clarity in my heart and I cannot be dishonest to the team.”Thanks Shastri & Co.He thanked “Ravi Bhai and the support group who were the engine behind this vehicle that moved up in Test Cricket consistently. You all have played a massive role in bringing this vision to life. Lastly, a big thank you to M.S. Dhoni who believed in me as captain and found me to be an able individual who could take Indian cricket forward.”Kohli thanked his teammates and the BCCI. The Board responded by acknowledging Kohli’s efforts as captain.One era ends and another will",0,0,1,0

"he last time Mumbai City took on Kerala Blasters, one team was on a four-game winning streak, the other had almost forgotten how to win. A lot has changed in a month.Mumbai is no longer the unbeatable defending champion. It, in fact, hasn’t won even once in its last five games and has slid to fourth place in the ISL table, from the pole position where it was when it played Blasters last month.On a rollThe men from Kochi had won that match 3-0. They haven’t looked back since. They are leading the table now, and are unbeaten for 10 games. The question is if they could make it 11 on Sunday, when it takes on Mumbai at the Tilak Maidan Stadium, Vasco. They must be confident they could: such has been the quality of their football from that match against Mumbai onwards.For Mumbai, the return leg is an opportunity to avenge that defeat and to get its act together. But it will need to up its game against a side that has looked the most complete side.Mumbai’s coach Des Buckingham said he enjoyed watching Blasters play. “Adrian Luna always impresses me.”The Uruguayan midfielder is a constant threat to any defence, with his passes and kicks from set-pieces.Blasters coach Ivan (Vukomanovic) said his team would have to remain focused. “The moment you think you are the best and start being arrogant, you are finished, you’re history,” Vukomanovic said.

The Indian team’s strategy is expected to undergo paradigm shift as it faces a possibility of a clean sweep against South Africa in the third ODI here on Sunday.India's strategy looked completely out of sync with the white-ball game as the batters failed to keep the momentum in the middle overs and the bowlers, save Jasprit Bumrah, looked club class.In two matches, India has been only able to pick up seven wickets — four in the first game when Proteas batted first and only three in the second.R. Ashwin and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, the two senior-most bowlers, looked far from threatening. With the two players having flopped completely, it needs to be seen whether it will try out Jayant Yadav and Deepak Chahar in the next game.At Newlands, there will be more pace and bounce on the track and the Indian team that has been perennially struggling would want to avoid the ignominy of a 0-3 loss.For skipper Rahul, the whole tour, save his match-winning hundred in the first Test, has been a nightmare. Although he is being seen as a long-term future leader, there hasn't been any spark in his leadership.There hasn't been any tactical improvisations in the two games so far.Lack of energyVirat Kohli may have scored 51 in the first game but what is visible is his lack of energy on the field. Rahul would do well to imbibe some of it from his former captain.The two Iyers — Shreyas in batting and Venkatesh as an all-rounder — haven’t yet set the stage on fireIn all, massive improvement required in order to be competitive.South Africa has been fined 20% of the match fee for maintaining a slow over-rate against India in the second ODI at Parl, the ICC said on Saturday.

“I am delighted to confirm that the 15th season of the IPL will start in the last week of March and will run until May end,” BCCI secretary Jay Shah said in a statement.Date advancedThe BCCI had earlier been eyeing April 2 as the start date for the IPL. “Since all the stakeholders have proposed lesser day games, the tournament may be advanced to March 27,” revealed an IPL insider, citing anonymity.Due to the third wave resulting in a nationwide surge, the BCCI will try and host the IPL in the Mumbai-Pune corridor. However, if it doesn’t work out, the event may be relocated to either UAE or South Africa.Shah, however, stressed that the BCCI will try its best to stage the IPL in India and will confirm the venue before next month’s auction.“A majority of the team owners expressed their wish that the tournament be held in India. The BCCI was always keen on staging the 2022 edition that will see two new teams — Ahmedabad and Lucknow — in India. I can tell you that we will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that the IPL stays in India,” Shah said.“The BCCI has not compromised on the health and safety of its stakeholders in the past and will concurrently work on Plan B since the COVID-19 situation with new variants remains fluid.

Mohammed Hafeez has been one of cricket’s most durable men. The Pakistan all-rounder was 41 when he announced his retirement from the international game early this month.His last match for Pakistan was the semifinal against Australia in the T20 World Cup at Dubai last November. He soon found himself playing in a tournament for the international cricketers.Turning out for Asia Lions at the Legends League Cricket, he played a splendid cameo to help his side chase down a daunting target set by World Giants at the Al Amerat Cricket Stadium here on Friday night. His 13-ball 27 was what the Lions needed after the second-wicket stand of 88 between the Sri Lankan duo of Tillakaratne Dilshan (52, 32b) and Upul Tharanga (63, 43b).Shortly after his team scored a six-wicket win with four balls to spare, Hafeez said he was happy to be part of the league. “I personally enjoyed playing with the (former) stars of world cricket,” he said. “Sharing the dressing room with them was really special and so is having World Cup-winning Sri Lanka skipper Arjuna Ranatunga as coach. As a child, I grew up watching him.”He feels the league is a wonderful initiative. “I really want to congratulate the organisers on bringing (all the cricketers) under one roof,” he said. “As a fan I am very happy.”Kevin O’Brien could not have been as happy, though. The Irish all-rounder’s 95 off 46 balls went in vain, as the Giants’ 205 for seven was overtaken by Lions. “It was a very good wicket and I enjoyed batting out there,” said O’Brien. “The standard of cricket here is good.

If you have a chance, you need to take it quickly, maybe in the first touch itself, if possible,” Dennerby said.“We need to convert our chances. We were a little slow in the last match and that gave the rival defenders time to recover, and come at us.

Subhas Bhowmick, one of Indian football’s most vibrant personalities, passed away at a nursing home here on Saturday. He was 71.The legendary forward’s fortitude and determination fetched the national side and the clubs he played for a host of laurels. The same drive was replicated in his later avatar as coach. The LG ASEAN Cup triumph that he fashioned as East Bengal coach is still regarded as one of the best feats by an Indian manager at the club level.Bhowmick, known by his nickname ‘Bhombol’ among the football fraternity, represented the last generation of players who have witnessed India making a podium finish in a continental championship.He prominently figured in the Indian team that won the 1970 Bangkok Asian Games bronze. He was also part of the Indian team that jointly won the Pesta Sukan Cup with South Vietnam in Singapore in 1971.At a time when international engagements were few and far between, Bhowmick represented India in 24 internationals and scored nine goals.He made an equally big impact as coach, winning the country’s top tournament — the I-League — twice with East Bengal and once with Goan giant Churchill Brothers.Arriving in Kolkata (then Calcutta) from North Bengal’s Raigunj in the latter half of the 1960s, Bhowmick was successful as a winger in the four-forward system prevalent at that ti",0,0,1,0

Slowly Chennaiyin started asking questions but yet again the team’s profligacy in front of the goal was on display as Rahim Ali fluffed two easy chances within a space of a minute at the half-hour mark.Loopy deliveryVladimir Koman sent in a loopy delivery and found Rahim on-side and unmarked but the Indian striker hurriedly took a weak shot that rolled to the ’keeper. Moments later he received a long ball from the backline and had only the ’keeper to beat but a heavy first touch sent the ball off-target.Poor goalkeepingAgainst the run of play, NorthEast went ahead thanks to a poor bit of goalkeeping from Debjit Majumder.Defending a corner at the far post, Debjit made a weak attempt with his hands and palmed it down in front of Laldanmawia Ralte who tapped it in easily to help NEUFC take the lead in the 35th minute.Though NEUFC kept the pressure on CFC in the final fifteen minutes of the match, it missed a slew of easy chances and slumped to its eighth defeat of the season.
The result: Chennaiyin FC 2 (Ariel Borysiuk 52, Vladimir Koman 58) bt NorthEast United FC 1 (Laldanmawia Ralte",0,0,1,0

Team ‘Special K’ won 7-5, 6-4 in one hour 35 minutes.Special spectatorIt was a third Slam title for the 25-year-old Barty after her breakthrough French Open success in 2019 and Wimbledon last year, joining Serena Williams as the only active players to win Majors on all three surfaces.She achieved the feat with Christine O’Neill, the last Australian man or woman to win in Melbourne, watching in the stadium. O’Neill won the title in 1978.Both players comfortably held their early service games, offering few chances. But Collins was employing her powerful groundstrokes and they were causing trouble. With the crowd roaring her on, Barty raced home 6-3 in 32 minutes.Collins came storming back, breaking Barty for 2-0 in the second set. Collins fended off two break-points to hold serve and while Barty won her next service game to love the American was pumped up and broke again for 5-1 as the top seed sent down two double-faults.Barty was in deep trouble but incredibly found a way back, breaking for 2-5 with some crisp winners then breaking again for 4-5 as Collins floundered serving for the set.She forced a tie-break and was always in charge to collect her fourth victory in five encounters with Collins and make history for Australia.Dynamic duoThe Aussie doubles winners, especially Kyrgios, had come in for plenty of criticism for their antics during their run to the final.They had been involved in altercations with opponents, had whipped boorish home fans into a frenzy, argued with umpires, smashed racquets and made obscene gestures. But the dynamic duo, who have been friends since they were nine years old, were too strong in a clash of unseeded pairs.This is a dream come true for me, and I am so proud to be an AussieBarty

Kiyan Nassiri turned an unlikely hero for ATK Mohun Bagan as he performed a hat-trick, after coming in as a late substitute, and helped his team beat traditional rival SC East Bengal 3-1 in an ISL-8 fixture at Fatorda on Saturday.Sideol strikesSC EB went into the lead early in the second half through a goal from Darren Sidoel. Kiyan arrived just after the hour mark and turned the game around for ATK MB.The 21-year-old forward found the equaliser three minutes after his arrival and struck twice in injury time in the second half.SC EB, which started with two specialist strikers in Croatian Antonio Perosevic and the newly arrived Brazilian Marcelo Rebeiro, did well on the counter-attacks.The ploy seemed to work well as SC EB earned the first good opportunity of the match in the 25th minute but Marcelo wasted the opportunity with a wayward attempt.ATK MB returned strongly after the break but saw a Liston Colaco attempt come off the cross-piece. It was SC EB which found the lead off a corner as Sidoel converted in the 56th minute.Stepping inATK MB coach Juan Ferrando introduced Kiyan in the 61st minute after his regular attackers — David Williams, Hugo Boumous and Liston Colaco – repeatedly failed to find the target.Kiyan, who is the son of the former East Bengal star Jamshid Nassiri, announced his arrival with the equaliser in the 64th minute.After Williams blew a penalty in the 66th minute, it was Kiyan who found the lead for ATK MB in the second minute of added time. He added another two minutes later to make it an extraordinary night for himself and ATK MB.The result helped ATK MB climb into the top four with 19 points from 11 matches while SC EB slid to the bottom of the table with nine points from 14 games.
The result:
 ATK Mohun Bagan 3 (Kiyan Nassiri 64, 90+2, 90+4) bt SC East Bengal 1 (Darren Sidoel 54).

India defeated defending champion Bangladesh by five wickets in the quarterfinals of the ICC U-19 World Cup here on Saturday. Chasing 112 for victory, India lost opener Harnoor Singh for a duck. But the in-form Angkrish Raghuvanshi’s fighting knock (44, 65b, 7x4) helped India reach the target in 30.5 overs and enter the semifinals.Earlier, left-arm seamer Ravi Kumar, named the Man-of-the-Match, bowled a sensational opening spell as India restricted Bangladesh to 111 in 37.1 overs. Ravi finished with excellent figures of 7-1-14-3 on a tricky pitch. Ravi’s inswinger beat Mahfijul Islam (2) all ends up in the second over. Iftakher Hossain (1) was then done in by the slowness of the track.No. 3 Prantik Nawrose (7) offered a catch to slip as Bangladesh was reduced to 14 for three in the eighth over.The team was 56 for seven at one stage before S.M.

"Sohail. P.K. Ajith Kumar
Sparks fly invariably when India meets Pakistan across 22 yards. But it is only in the ICC events the two teams come face to face nowadays. That is a pity, according to Aamer Sohail, the former Pakistan captain who himself has featured in some of the memorable contests between the two teams. “The ICC keeps on emphasising that politics should not be involved as far as cricket is concerned and I agree with that,” he told
The Hindu
. “A contest between India and Pakistan always brings that anticipation all around the world. Cricket fans are deprived of that.”
The Pakistan fans were, of course, delighted that their team finally registered a victory against India, at the recent T20 World Cup. “It took a long time coming, didn’t it?” said Sohail, who is here as a television commentator for Legends League Cricket. “The people back home in Pakistan were very happy.”He, however, feels there is room for improvement as far as the current Pakistan side is concerned. “Shaheen Afridi is the only consistent fast bowler,” he said. “And we don't reverse swing the ball the way we used to. We tend to struggle in the middle overs.”Sohail thinks India's future is bright despite Virat Kohli quitting captaincy. “Rohit Sharma is a good choice as a captain,” he said. “His batting doesn't seem to get affected by captaincy. Of course, his experience as Mumbai Indians skipper at the IPL would help.” He said Indian cricket benefited a great deal from the IPL. “It helps the new players get prepared and makes them comfortable with the camera,” he said.Sohail said India’s young batters should be conscious of the great legacy of their country. “They shouldn’t forget that India has always produced the world’s best batters,” he said. “The ability to hit sixes can be handy in T20 but the longer format is more important. You need technique for that.”About the Legends League, he said it was a success. “It has been a revelation,” he said.

"olkata Thunderbolts head coach Sunny Joseph is optimistic about his side’s chances in the Prime Volleyball League (PVL) despite the obstacles posed by Covid-19 during the preparation phase.Sunny said Thunderbolts had the potential to finish well in the league.“The time for preparations was less. The pandemic was a big problem because of which we had to shift our camp from Kochi to Hyderabad. We lost so many practice sessions due to this. Still, we are prepared and I expect my team to be in the final,” Sunny said at a virtual press conference on Saturday. “First we have to beat Calicut Heroes (on February 7), then we will have different strategies for different teams.”Sunny backed his players to do well. “All 12 are key players. They are of equal standard and all of them are players of high caliber.”Ashwal Rai, who was named the captain of Thunderbolts, said: “It’s a proud moment for me. I will try to carry out my responsibility well. Sunny Sir has trained us well. Our team bonding is one of the strengths of the side.”

"n order to make bouts more attractive, the United World Wrestling (UWW) Bureau has made some rule changes with immediate effect.The UWW has decided to reward the more active wrestler. “With the updated rules, the active wrestler will receive points for any attacking moves and one point if his/her opponent fails to score during the 30-second activity period,” UWW said in a statement.Earlier, the active wrestler used to get points either for his moves or for the opponent’s inactivity during such a period.The new rules have become stricter towards the wrestlers fleeing the mat or the hold (of an opponent).Such wrestlers will now be penalised with a caution and a point even before being served with a verbal warning. The penalty point will be awarded over and above the points scored through moves.The UWW Bureau has also modified a rule relating to winning ‘by fall.’“If a wrestler is in a danger position and simulates an injury (by screaming) while his/her opponent is looking for the fall, the referee will no longer stop the bout. In this case, the referee will ask for the fall and the mat chairman will confirm it,” said the statement.There is a change related to the challenge to a decision awarding certain points. “Coaches can now request for a challenge after the points are published on the scoreboard or five seconds after the wrestlers come to neutral position.”The UWW has decided to distribute the qualification round draws equally to provide better balance to the upper and lower parts of the main draws.The UWW removed the verbal warning for passivity for under-15, under-17 (cadet) and veterans as periods are shorter (two minutes) than that (three minutes) in under-20 (junior), under-23 and seni",0,0,1,0

"t a time when the format that was once derided as pyjama cricket is struggling to remain relevant, it is back in the limelight.Even as cricket fans continue to wonder who India’s next Test captain will be and who their favourite IPL franchise will sign/buy at the mega-auction next weekend, all eyes would be on Motera come Sunday afternoon.Great significanceIndia’s three-match ODI series versus the West Indies, starting at the Narendra Modi Stadium, will be significant in more ways than one. Besides being Virat Kohli’s maiden appearance under Rohit Sharma’s captaincy, Sunday’s series-opener will also be a historic milestone in India’s glorious ODI cricket history.The two-time World champion will become the first team to feature in 1,000 ODIs. Despite the challenges in getting the ideal combination on the park due to COVID-19-related issues, India will be hoping to celebrate the occasion with a win and get its 2023 World Cup preparation back on track.The ODI series whitewash in South Africa last month was an eye-opener on how India needs to tick multiple boxes in order to repeat the 2011 heroics when the World Cup will return to home soil in 2023. Ditto is the case with the West Indies, who suffered a shock series defeat at the hands of Ireland in its last ODI assignment.As a result, veteran Kemar Roach has been recalled after being out of limited-overs cricket for more than two years.India will see Rohit’s return to the field after missing the South Africa tour due to a recurring hamstring injury. Besides proving his fitness, the versatile batter will also need to ensure that Rohit the captain, gets the best out of Kohli the batter.With Shikhar Dhawan ruled out of the first two ODIs and K.L. Rahul unavailable for the opening match, the onus will yet again be on Rohit and Kohli. It will also be interesting to see whether Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav can revive their magical partnership in the spin department and give India the much-needed impetus. If Rohit-Kohli and Kul-Cha can find their mojo, the euphoria of ODI cricket may have more than a thousand reasons to last for another week.
The teams (from):

India: Rohit Sharma (Capt.), Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, Deepak Hooda, Rishabh Pant (wicket-keeper), Deepak Chahar, Shardul Thakur, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Washington Sundar, Ravi Bishnoi, Mohd. Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Avesh Khan, Ishan Kishan, and Shahrukh Khan.

West Indies: Kieron Pollard (Capt.), Nicholas Pooran (Vice-Capt.), Fabian Allen, Darren Bravo, Roston Chase, Sheldon Cottrell, Dominic Drakes, Jason Holder, Shai Hope, Akeal Hosein, Brandon King, Kyle Mayers, Rovman Powell, Romario Shepherd, Odean Smith, and Hayden Walsh Jr.

"Matthew August. Special Arrangement
Prime Volleyball League (PVL) outfit Kolkata Thunderbolts’ American middle blocker Matthew August feels his team captain Ashwal Rai can achieve great heights if he gets the right kind of exposure.August — who bagged a silver medal in the NORCECA championship with the USA National team in 2019 and played in the USA professional league National Volleyball Association (NVA) and the Czech Republic league (Extraliga) — is delighted to know that fellow middle blocker Ashwal is keen to learn from him.“He is one of the most talented and gifted athletes I have seen in volleyball. As a middle blocker, it is fun watching him play. He is a very unique athlete — very tall, strong and a high jumper.“I am learning from him right now. But I will help him as much as possible if he wants and wherever he needs. “I think he can be one of the greats of the sport in general in the whole world. If he gets the exposure that he deserves, he can do amazing things for volleyball,” August said to
The Hindu
.
Back in the mixThe 25-year-old, who switched to coaching to take care of his mental health after spending two years overseas playing for nine to 10 months a year, looked forward to playing again in the PVL.“My experience (here) has been amazing so far… In Europe, you have people from all over the world come in and share their experiences. You learn a lot of different things.“Having the foreigners here is doing the same thing for the Indian players.“I share my ideas with younger middles (middle blockers) and I am learning from them as well. Just take different styles of what they are doing.”August said more exposure could improve the standard of Indian volleyball players.“The more players you get, the stronger this country will be. That is the key to expanding any nation’s volleyball community and expertise. It’s just the exposure that can take them forward.“Skill level is amazing (here). All these players are very passionate about the game, very athletic.“I am very keen to see the athleticism and strengths of other Indian players.“From the foreigner side, I know most of the foreigners. And I know they will help the teams they are in. This league is going to be very strong,” he said.

"ven before Ishan Kishan was officially announced as a member of India’s ODI squad for the three-match series versus the West Indies, captain Rohit Sharma announced the southpaw as his opening partner for Sunday’s series-opener at the Narendra Modi Stadium.Only option“Ishan is the only option we have and he will open. Mayank (Agarwal) was added to the squad but he has still not finished his quarantine since he joined slightly late, so Ishan will open tomorrow, unless there is an injury. Fingers crossed nothing like that happens,” Rohit said on Satuday.With Shikhar Dhawan and Ruturaj Gaikwad having been ruled out of the first two games after being down with COVID-19 infection and K.L. Rahul unavailable for the first match, the BCCI ealier in the week had announced that Mayank Agarwal had been asked to join as back-up for the ODI squad.On Saturday evening, the BCCI announced Ishan and Shahrukh Khan’s inclusion in the squad with Dhawan, Gaikwad and Shreyas Iyer in Covid-enforced isolation. Ishan will look to cement his place in the side and serve a reminder to IPL franchises ahead of the player auction.Rohit insisted that despite taking over the ODI captaincy, the vision and the approach of the team will more or less remain the same with an eye on the 2023 World Cup.“When Virat was the captain, I was the vice-captain.We pretty much went about the team in a similar fashion. I just have taken it from where he left. The team pretty much knows what is expected of them. We want to continue the same template,” Rohit said.Not much to change“There is not much we want to change, we have a good team, we have good players. Just that in certain occasions, there will be situations presented in front of us where we have to change our game a little bit. It is just that adaptability and being open to different things at different points we have spoken of. There is nothing that I need to change something drastically.”With Kohli having resigned as Test captain after India lost the series in South Africa, Rohit was expectedly asked about whether he was ready to take over the mantle in the longest format as well. The seasoned pro left it outside the off-stump.“Let’s leave the Test captaincy discussion for another day. For the time being, I am completely focused on the ODI and the T20I series versus West Indies,” Rohit said.

India was all over England before a gritty 95 by James Rew saved his team’s blushes, lifting it to 189 all out in the final of the Under-19 World Cup here on Saturday.Medium-pacer Raj Bawa (five for 31) ran through the England middle-order after the in-from left-arm seamer Ravi Kumar (four for 34) had struck two early blows.England was 91 for seven when Rew and James Sales (34 not out) defied India with a 93-run eight-wicket stand. Rew was unlucky to miss a hundred as he hit straight to the deep midwicket fielder. England’s innings ended soon after.Earlier, after England opted to bat, India struck in the second over when Ravi sent back Jacob Bethell (2).Ravi struck again in the next over, castling England skipper Tom Prest. Bawa then got into the act, picking up the important wicket of Thomas.He was on a hat-trick as George Bell had no answer to a peach of a delivery that reared up and took a deflection to wicketkeeper Dinesh Bana. Rew and Sales then rescued England.
The scores:

England 189 in 44.5 overs (James Rew 95, James Sales 34 n.o., Ravi Kumar 4/34, Raj Bawa 5/31) ",0,0,1,0
"Hanging tough: Sousa saved three matchpoints to turn the tables on Ymer. Special Arrangement
Finland youngster Emil Ruusuvuori earned a shot at his maiden ATP World Tour title with a hard-fought win over Kamil Majchrzak while Joao Sousa edged out Elias Ymer after saving three match points in high-quality semifinals at the Tata Open Maharashtra here on Saturday.Majchrzak got himself to a position where he could have served for the second set to force a decider, but it was the 22-year-old Ruusuvuori who emerged a 6-3, 7-6(0) winner after one hour and 46 minutes of engrossing tennis at the Balewadi Sports Complex.In the other semifinal, World No. 137 Sousa used all his experience to wriggle out of a tough situation against the talented Swede Ymer before winning 5-7, 7-6(4), 7-5 in three hours and 13 minutes.The first semifinal featured intense rallies right from the beginning with both Ruusuvuori, ranked 87th, and the 95th-ranked Majchrzak displaying their range of shots. It was only in the eighth game that a break opportunity opened up for the Finnish player which he utilised and went on to win the set.In the second, it was Majchrzak who broke in the eighth game. However, he was broken while serving for the set as Ruusuvuori stormed back into the set and blanked his opponent in the tie-breaker.In the other last-four clash, early breaks and solid holds put Ymer in the driver’s seat as the Swede raced to a 4-1 lead. Sousa, however, got a break back in the sixth game. The experienced Portuguese, despite facing two set points, managed to make it 5-5 with another break in the 10th game.Ymer picked himself up and earned another break with an exquisite backhand winner after an intense rally. Sousa netted a forehand on the next point to drop serve before the Swede served out the set with ease.In the second, Sousa kept his nerve to win the tie-breaker 7-4. In the 10th game of the decider, Sousa was down 15-40 but managed to save both match points. Though Ymer earned a third matchpoint in the game, he missed it with a backhand return error.The Portuguese battled on and made his first matchpoint opportunity count in the 12th g",0,0,1,0

The Kochi side seemed to bank too much on the captain A. Karthik’s brilliance and experience.The second set was no different with the scores level at the start before Hyderabad went ahead after 9-all. Again, it was a super point at 12-10 which helped Hyderabad to take a 14-10 lead and then a splendid double block saw it clinch a point and the set.Pushed to back footThings didn’t change the Kochi way even in the third set with Rohit once again brilliant at the net. His spiking at most critical points pushed Kochi onto the back foot.Hyderabad clinched the third set too, thanks to another super point and a super serve as Rohit, who was adjudged player of the match, finished it in style.Kochi later had the satisfaction of winning the last set.Earlier, doubles Olympic medallist and ace shuttler P.V.

"Ready to tussle: Germanpreet Singh at a Chennaiyin training session. Focus Sports/ISL
When Chennaiyin FC takes on Mumbai City FC in the ISL in Fatorda on Sunday, the circumstances couldn’t be more different from when the two sides met earlier in the competition.Back in December, both teams had had strong starts to their campaigns and, in a closely-contested match, Mumbai prevailed with an 86th-minute winner.Since then both teams have been scrappy and are going through a rough patch with negligible success in recent times.Chennaiyin has just one win in the last five matches and had a forgettable encounter with SC East Bengal where it squandered a 2-0 first-half lead, conceding a late equaliser.CFC’s strength — its compact defence — has let the team down often in recent times.“We need to keep our full concentration in the defensive set-piece. We need to mark well. Now we play against one of the best teams and they have strong players. We need to be focused and try to dominate the game,” said CFC coach Bozidar Bandovic.The team has also now suffered two injury blows with Vladimir Koman and Sajid Dhot ruled out for Sunday’s fixture.Buckingham hopefulMeanwhile, Mumbai is searching for its first win since the 1-0 victory over Chennaiyin, but coach Des Buckingham is hopeful his team can regain the form shown in the first part of the season.“The way we have played in the last few games, I am very happy. We have got seven games now and, starting tomorrow, the aim will be to get back to winning ways,” s",0,0,1,0

“The timing of the senior Nationals (to be held in Bhubaneswar from February 7) clashing with the Rupay Prime Volleyball League didn’t come as a surprise at all,” PVL CEO Joy Bhattacharya said at a virtual media interaction on Friday.“I can only say this. More the opportunities for players, the better for them. But, I must say, in PVL, players are the No. 1 priority,” he said.Joy said the PVL, which would see volleyballers in action after almost two years, would provide footage the players could look at at the end of the month-long event and keep looking ahead.“It is a huge opportunity for everyone involved in volleyball and for all those young talent watching it,” he said.“Yes, we are definitely looking at a longer league with more teams and more venues. But the reality of Indian sporting league is it depends on sponsorship. We need team owners who can invest and wait at least five years. Luckily, we have seven of them in the PVL now who are very competent and passionate about the sport and all seven are involved in the managing committee.“This actually made it possible to shift the League from Kochi (due to Omicron threat) to Hyderabad with ease,” Joy explained.On women’s PVL, Joy said everyone involved was definitely keen but would want to take things one step at a time. First successfully conduct the men’s league and then even consider similar leagues in men’s and women’s beach volleyball",0,0,1,0

The last time we were here, we did okay. We didn’t win the series but we pushed them. It’s time to get one step further,” Pollard said.With India resting key pacers, West Indies may fancy itself of ending India’s six-year unbeaten reign at home.But Pollard was cautious. “We are on a level-playing field. It’s not about who is the favourite. We just need to focus on what we need to do.”

Ashwin has been included subject to passing a fitness test, Chetan said, Rahul and Washington Sundar were unavailable having hurting themselves during the West Indies ODI series.Shardul Thakur has been rested, while Shubman Gill and Ravindra Jadeja have been recalled after proving their fitness. With Axar Patel likely to be available for the second Test, Saurabh Kumar, the Uttar Pradesh left-arm spinner, is the lone new face in the Test squad.The big talking point, however, was the omission of Rahane, Pujara, Ishant and Saha who have been regulars in the Test set-up for over a decade. Chetan said he had had discussions with each of them just after the South Africa series, adding that the door would always be open for them.“We had told them that they would not be considered for these two Tests,” Chetan said. “We want to see them perform in the Ranji Trophy.” While Pujara and Rahane are participating in the Ranji Trophy, Ishant and Saha are not.Saha reactsSpeaking to
Sportstar , Saha revealed that coach Rahul Dravid had told him during the South Africa tour that he should not be surprised if the selectors did not pick him for the Lanka series. “Rahul
bhai told me that if you want to take any decision, you may consider. I told him that I don’t want to take a call yet because there is plenty of cricket left in me and also there is IPL. I have always played for the love of the game and till the time I enjoy it, I will play.”
The squads:
T20Is: Rohit Sharma (Capt.), Jasprit Bumrah (Vice-Capt.), Ruturaj Gaikwad, Shreyas Iyer, Suryakumar Yadav, Sanju Samson (wk), Ishan Kishan (wk), Venkatesh Iyer, Deepak Chahar, Deepak Hooda, Ravindra Jadeja, Yuzvendra Chahal, Ravi Bishnoi, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Siraj, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Harshal Patel and Avesh Khan.

"Unstoppable:Shahrukh tore the Delhi bowlers apart,smashing 20 fours and 10 sixes.File photo: JOTHI RAMALINGAM

It was ‘power play’ by Shahrukh Khan as Tamil Nadu conquered a peak. The onslaught was in one word ‘brutal.’Tamil Nadu whipped up an incredible 419 runs on day three with the belligerent Shahrukh leading the charge with booming blows at the ACA Stadium as the side pulled off a heist and grabbed the lead in this Ranji duel.And it was a classic case of the hunter becoming the hunted. A heavy hitter such as Shahrukh changes the bowlers’ mindset from taking wickets to stemming the run-flow.The highlightsShahrukh’s stunning 194 (148b, 20x4, 10x6) along with B. Indrajith’s fleet-footed and pristine 117 (149b, 17x4, 2x6) were the highlights as Tamil Nadu overhauled Delhi’s 452.Tamil Nadu was eventually dismissed for 494 — left-arm spinner Vikas Mishra, with an easy action and a useful arm ball, scalped six — here on Saturday.And let’s not forget N. Jagadeesan’s vital 50 or Kaushik Gandhi’s valuable 55 at the top of the order.Things looked bleak for Tamil Nadu at 162 for five when skipper Vijay Shankar was smartly picked up at silly point by Jonty Sidhu off Vikas.Complexion changesEnter the explosive Shahrukh and the whole complexion changed. Shahrukh, the marauder, and Indrajith, the artist, put on 134 for the sixth wicket.The inspired Shahrukh, unruffled by the situation, the conditions or the attack, bludgeoned his drives, whipped his flicks, dumped the ball into the stands and hooked and pulled the pacemen for sixes.He generates enormous power with his flourishing back-lift, strong wrists and shoulders and tremendous bat speed. His footwork isn’t great, but he gets behind the line and whacks the ball with a still head.Calm and composedThe calm and composed Indrajith danced down to the spinners, handled pacemen with confidence, timed the ball sweetly and found the gaps with precision on either side.Indrajith, playing across, fell to Nitish Rana’s off-break but Shahrukh found in Jagadeesan a determined partner who wisely played second fiddle and rotated the strike.The two added a hectic 178 runs as Shahrukh cut loose and Jagadesan held firm. And the rampaging Tamil Nadi took the lead. What a comeback!

"Day to remember:Vathsal came up with his maiden ton in only his second match.Special Arrangement
Edhen Apple Tom could be forgiven if he feels life can be so easy.Three days ago, he made his First Class debut at the age of 17. He celebrated it with a wicket off his very first ball, becoming the first from Kerala to achieve the feat.Remarkably, on Saturday, he did it in the second innings too. He had D.B. Ravi Teja edging to slip with his first ball. Before that, he had taken a fine diving catch at short-leg.Man-of-the-MatchLater in the day, he was celebrating a Ranji Trophy victory — Kerala’s innings and 166-run win against Meghalaya at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Ground. And, he was named Man-of-the-Match.Meghalaya, playing in the Elite Group for the first time, once again found the four-pronged Kerala pace attack too hot to handle.Captain Sachin Baby didn’t have to use even one ball of spin in the first innings. In the second, though, he turned to the off-spin of Jalaj Saxena at the end of 41 overs. Six wickets had fallen by then.Manu had given Kerala a splendid start when he had Kishan Lyngdoh playing the fourth ball of the innings onto the stumps. Then Thampi, who looked the sharpest, had Wallam Kynshi caught by the boy of the moment, Edhen.Khurana excelsIn his next over, Thampi removed Meghalaya captain and first-innings hero Punit Bisht, whose tame shot was taken by Jalaj at point. Then Edhen came into the attack and took his customary wicket off the first ball. He would claim one more wicket — that of Chirag Khurana, who played some glorious strokes in his 70-ball 75 (15x4) before he fell lbw.Earlier, Vathsal Govind completed a well-deserved hundred (106 not out, 193b, 8x4, 1x6) before Kerala, which had resumed at 454 for eight, declared its innings at 505 for nine. The 22-year-old, playing only his second Ranji match, looked solid and lived up to expectations.Kerala’s next match is against Gujarat and Meghalaya’s is against Madhya Pradesh. Both the games start here on February 24.

The Saurashtra players looked anxious as the two on-field umpires made their way to the Mumbai dugout to find out if Prithvi Shaw was going to enforce the follow-on. Following a brief chat with Mumbai head coach Amol Muzumdar, the officials informed the Saurashtra dugout that their batters had to pad up again.So, after being bowled out for 220 in less than two sessions, openers Harvik Desai and Snell Patel put on 105 for the first wicket, still trailing by 219 runs on the third day of the Ranji Trophy tie here on Saturday.They were particularly severe on the spinners, advancing to attack the delivery or quickly retreating to allow more time to place their shots.Pujara failsEarlier in the morning, when Mohit Avasthi (4/56), playing his debut First Class match, rapped Cheteshwar Pujara on the knee roll to strike for Mumbai, he ran to fine leg, where the Saurashtra dugout was, to celebrate.Avasthi stayed in that testing channel outside off for two balls before getting one to shape into Pujara, who was struck in front. There was more disappointment in store for Pujara, who was dropped for the home Tests against Sri Lanka later in the day.Avasthi exhibited the speed and the smarts to trouble the Saurashtra top-order. He had Vishvarajsinh Jadeja caught behind with one that pitched just short of a good length and climbed a few inches before getting Arpit Vasavada caught at slip.This was after left-arm spinner Shams Mulani (4/55) had removed Snell and Harvik, both caught by Ajinkya Rahane at slip.Attractive strokesFrom a precarious 76 for five, Sheldon Jackson and Prerak Mankad put on 55 for the sixth wicket, playing some attractive strokes. But the resistance was short-lived as Mankad was caught at slip off Avasthi immediately after lunch.Jackson, meanwhile, was composed and unhurried while compiling 61 off 88 balls, including eight fours and a six. He was caught in the deep off off-spinner Tanush Kotian. Kotian and Mulani then wrapped up the last three wickets for 20 runs.

Arjun Kadhe and his Austrian partner Alexander Erler won the doubles title at the second leg of the Bengaluru Open, beating Saketh Myneni and Ramkumar Ramanathan 6-3, 6-7(4), [10-7] on Saturday.For Kadhe, it was the second Challenger doubles title this year. For Erler, it was a first-ever Challenger trophy.Myneni and Ramkumar secured a wild card into the doubles draw at the Dubai ATP 500 tournament that starts on Monday.Kadhe and Erler had never played together before and hadn’t even practised as a team ahead of the tournament. The rustiness showed at times on court, when they didn’t communicate well. But for a first-time team they were pretty solid.In the first set it was their return game that stood out.The Erler serve did come under pressure, like in the fifth game when it was broken.But they blunted the big serves of Myneni and Saketh effectively.In the second set, after a drama-free first nine service games, Erler was under pressure at 4-5, 15-40. But Myneni and Ramkumar fluffed all three set points. They however made amends in the tie-break, winning it to four points to even the contest.In the match tie-break, the all-Indian duo went up 5-2. But they lost six of the next seven points to hand back the initiative.Vukic meets KuzmanovSunday’s singles final will see top seed Aleksandar Vukic take on Dimitar Kuzmanov.

"On a high:Bhuvneshwar should be all fired up for final T20I.
| Photo Credit: Bikas Das
India enters the third and final T20I against the West Indies here on Sunday with an unassailable 2-0 lead, which could lead the host to test the bench strength.At a minimum, a couple of changes will certainly happen, as Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant have been rested for this outing and the Sri Lanka T20I series.Batting replacementsShreyas Iyer, Deepak Hooda and Ruturaj Gaikwad, all of whom did not feature in the first two T20Is, are the batting replacements available. Shreyas can fill in for Kohli in the middle-order, while Hooda is in line to make his T20I debut.Ishan Kishan will take over wicketkeeping duties from Pant. If Kishan is relieved of his opener’s spot, Gaikwad could be drafted in.The team management will be tempted to retain Bhuvneshwar Kumar, given his splendid show in the second T20I.Great overA stellar 19th over, in which he conceded just four runs and picked up the big wicket of Nicholas Pooran, sealed the match in India’s favour.A clever mix of yorkers, slower deliveries and bouncers, executed perfectly in a pressure situation, proved that Bhuvneshwar is well equipped to spearhead India’s end-overs bowling.He more than made up for spilling a caught and bowled chance offered by Rovman Powell, which caused captain Rohit Sharma to kick the ball in frustration.Only last month, Bhuvneshwar’s wicketless run in the ODI leg of the South Africa tour had raised eyebrows. The fast bowler, who has not played a Test since 2018 due to recurring injury concerns, has silenced his doubters.If Bhuvneshwar can stay fit, he can play a key role at the ICC T20 World Cup later this year.Bhuvneshwar’s pace partners Deepak Chahar and Harshal Patel went for runs, and failed to get a wicket, on Friday. Given that Rohit has the liberty to tinker with the team combination, the likes of benched speedsters Shardul Thakur, Mohammed Siraj and Avesh Khan will fancy their chances.Middle-order’s burdenWest Indies did put up a fight in the second match, but there still remains a gulf in quality between the two sides.At the top of the order, Brandon King and Kyle Mayers have yet to fire.The visitors must make best use of the PowerPlay, which will then ease the heavy burden placed on middle-order batters Pooran and Powell. Windies will strive for a better catching display on Sunday, after having dropped no less than three chances on Friday.
The teams (from):

India: Rohit Sharma (Capt.), Ishan Kishan, Shreyas Iyer, Surya Kumar Yadav, Venkatesh Iyer, Deepak Chahar, Shardul Thakur, Ravi Bishnoi, Yuzvendra Chahal, Mohd. Siraj, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Avesh Khan, Harshal Patel, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Deepak Hooda and Kuldeep Yadav.

"Classy:Abhimanyu drove and pulled well on either sideof the wicket.BISWARANJAN ROUT
| Photo Credit: Biswaranjan Rout
Bengal captain Abhimanyu Easwaran took charge of a tough run chase by scoring an unbeaten half-century as his side’s Ranji Trophy Elite Group B match against Baroda headed for an interesting finish at the Barabati Stadium here on Saturday.Baroda, beginning from 144 for five, rode on wicketkeeper-batter Mitesh Patel’s second consecutive half-century to score 255 in its second innings and set Bengal a challenging target of 349 on the penultimate day. Bengal was at 146 for two at stumps and needs 203 more on the final day.Unaffected by Bengal’s humiliating first innings total of 88, Abhimanyu (79 batting, 114b, 7x4) batted positively and guided his younger opening partner Sudip Gharami (27), who was tentative early on, to lay a sound 89-run stand despite the pressure created by the disciplined Baroda bowlers.Looking in good touch, Abhimanyu played each ball on merit. He drove and pulled well to get some lovely boundaries on either side and did not miss any chance to run hard and rotate the strike.Unbroken standEven after the dismissal of Gharami, who was bowled by a sharp one from Atit Sheth, and Writtick Chatterjee — who was promoted up the order but could not capitalise on the opportunity — in quick succession, Abhimanyu collaborated with seasoned hand Anustup Majumdar (22 batting, 51b, 2x4) to put up an unbroken 56-run partnership for the third wicket.Anustup played the supporting role really well.Earlier, Baroda overcame a minor jolt of losing overnight set batter Pratyush Kumar in the first over to set a stiff target for Bengal.Even as the Bengal pacers continuously looked for wickets, Mitesh (57, 100b, 5x4) again showed his utility down the order. The 24-year-old associated with Dhruv Patel (34) and Sheth (20) to gather 64 and 43 for the seventh and eighth wickets respectively.Attractive shotsMitesh played some attractive shots on the leg side before being caught at deep midwicket off Akash Deep, who bowled some energetic spells and claimed three wickets with a good economy rate, as Baroda’s second essay ended midway through the middle session.

"Not enough:Arindam’s century could not take Railways past Karnataka’s total.File photo
| Photo Credit: SHIV KUMAR PUSHPAKAR
Arindam Ghosh’s brilliant century (105) and Mohammad Saif’s delightful 82 was not enough to help Railways overhaul Karnataka’s huge first-innings total of 481 as the former fell short by 55 runs on the third day of the Elite Group C Ranji Trophy match here on Saturday.It was always going to be a tall order for Railways but Arindam and Saif’s 96-run stand for the fourth wicket gave the side a glimmer of hope. However, Karnataka pacers Ronit More and Vidyadhar Patil picked up crucial wickets to help the side take the crucial first-innings lead.Doing it in styleArindam, who was unbeaten on 78 overnight, played cautiously in the first session preferring to take singles till he reached 91. From there, he first hit off-spinner K. Gowtham for a six over mid-wicket before stepping out and lofting More over the pacer’s head to bring his hundred in style.At the other end, after a watchful start, the left-handed Saif started playing his strokes freely with three elegantly executed straight drives off the pacers. He was lucky when he was dropped on 40 by Mayank Agarwal off More just after the second new ball was taken.Signs of aggressionThe left-hander used the late-cuts against the spinners on a fast outfield before showing aggression. He first stepped out to hit Shreyas Gopal for a six and then launched into Vidyadhar.He hit the medium-pacer for four consecutive boundaries that included a straight drive, two pulls towards square-leg and a flick to the fine-leg fence. However, his aggression eventually caught up with him as he was stumped trying to take on Gowtham.Debutant Yuvraj Singh, who took a fifer on the second day, showed he was handy with the bat too, contributing with a valuable 48. Yuvraj and Avinash Yadav added 60 runs for the eighth wicket and Railways was in the hunt till the two were in the middle. Just at the stroke of tea, Yuvraj was caught behind off More who then cleaned up the tail.In the second innings, Karnataka was 63 for one at stumps — a lead of 118. Mayank was batting on 37.

Inspired spells from Rajasthan medium-pacers Aniket Choudhary and Tanveer Haq put their side on road to victory against Andhra in the Group E Ranji Trophy match at the St. Xavier’s College ground here on Saturday.The duo prised out the top-order cheaply after Ashok Menaria and Mahipal Lomror’s half-centuries set a daunting target (368) for Andhra.Gutsy standChasing the stiff target on a dicey wicket, Andhra ended the penultimate day at 100 for four, having recovered from a precarious 41 for four.The recovery was made possible by some gutsy batting by Ricky Bhui (31 not) and Y. Sandeep (32 not out) who figured in an unbroken 59-run stand for the fifth wicket.Captain K.S. Bharat’s (6) ill-judged reverse-sweep off Shubham Sharma left the Andhra innings in disarray at 41 for four. The Andhra skipper had tried the shot a few times but failed to connect and when he eventually did, it resulted in a tame catch to wicketkeeper Menaria.Sandeep was positive and punished the loose deliveries and it had an effect on his partner who overcame his initial jitters to stroke the ball fluently.Earlier, Andhra medium-pacer Sasikanth struck quick blows to put Rajasthan on the backfoot.Stemming the rotHowever, captain Menaria (79) and Lomror (79) joined forces to stem the rot. They batted in contrasting styles to compile half-centuries. While Lomror was watchful and played the ball on merit, Menaria was adventurous. He took on the spinners and carted them to all parts of the field to quickly advance to fifty.After Lomror’s departure, Menaria, with the help of the lower-order, propped up the innings. He added 44 runs for the seventh wicket with Shubham Sharma (23) and another 42 runs for the eighth wicket with Manav Suthar (24 not out) before holing out.Aniket Choudhary (23) hit a flurry off boundaries off the medium-pacers to add 34 runs for the last wicket with Suthar and left Andhra a mountain to climb.

Kerala Blasters and ATK Mohun Bagan have been playing some fabulous football this season. When such well-equipped teams clash, sparks are expected to fly.Fly they did at Vasco on Saturday. The exciting encounter that saw plenty of action ended in a 2-2 draw, with the last goal coming with just seconds left in injury time. Adrian Luna put Blasters twice ahead but David Williams and then Joni Kauko brought ATK Mohun Bagan back into the game. The Kolkatans now have 30 points. Blasters remain fourth with 27 points.Luna’s first goal came off a free-kick in the seventh minute, from a few yards outside the box. It was Carl McHugh’s foul against Sahal Samad that paved the way for that free-kick.Luna bent the ball magnificently in to the left corner of the net. Goalkeeper Amrinder Singh, who was perhaps unsighted by the wall put up his defenders, had little chance to stop it.ATK Mohun Bagan, however, wasted no time to hit back. A through ball from Kauko found Pritam Kotal inside the box. Kotal then gave a superb pass to a swiftly advancing Williams, who slammed the ball in.Ninteen minutes into the second-half, Luna produced another moment of magic as he floated the ball beautifully above Amrinder’s head from the corner of the box after receiving a fine cross from Lalthathanga Khawlhring.

"hahrukh Khan, whose blitzkrieg shut out Delhi, remembers a conversation with assistant coach R. Prasanna before he went in to bat here on Saturday.The explosive Shahrukh revealed to
The Hindu , “Prasanna told me, ‘You play your natural game. If the ball is in your slot, hit it. Don’t bother about white or red-ball cricket. Your methods have worked big time in white-ball cricket. There is no need to depart from it’.”Shahrukh walked in when Tamil Nadu was in deep trouble having lost half the side for 162 and he proceeded to conjure a blistering thrill-a-minute 148-ball 194, making light of his pressure, for his maiden Ranji hundred.“More than the hundred, what gave me maximum satisfaction was that we were able to take the lead against Delhi. We are a closely knit unit. The team always comes first,” said Shahrukh.Asked about his century partnerships with B. Indrajith and N. Jagadeesan, Shahrukh said, “Both told me ‘You play your natural game.’ And what an innings Indrajith played, full of class. Jagadeesan too batted well.”Was there more pressure on him as Tamil Nadu neared Delhi’s first innings total of 452? Shahrukh replied, “The target was there at the back of my mind but I did not think too much about it. I knew if I continued to play my shots, we would surpass the t",0,0,1,0

Ahmedabad Defenders scored a hard-fought 7-15, 15-10, 15-13, 15-14, 10-15 win over Kolkata Thunderbolts to make it to the last four stage of the Rupay Prime Volleyball League championship at the GMC Balayogi Stadium (Gachibowli) in Hyderabad on Saturday.This was fourth win in five matches for Defenders which took the team to the top of the points table with eight points while Thunderbolts suffered their second loss in five matches.K. Rahul and Vinit Kumar gave Thunderbolts a wonderful start and as usual captain Ashwal Rai was there all over. Vinit helped the team win a super point at 11-7 and wrap up the first set.John’s awesome spikingIn the second set, Defenders’ Shon T. John, who was adjudged ‘player of the match’, was dominant with his awesome spiking in the face of an erratic defence.In the third set, much to the surprise of Thunderbolts star player Ashwal Rai, Defenders’ Angamuthu came up with his trademark smashes, complemented ably by Hardeep Singh.In fact, it was the excellent coordination in defence by Defenders which made the difference as the normally brilliant Ashwal Rai, Mohammad Riyazudden were not given the liberty to run away with those telling spikes for which they were known. For Thunderbolts, Mathew August was off-colour this evening and that proved costly in the final analysis.

After tough talk between Presidents Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin over the Russian troop build-up on the Ukraine border, U.S. and Russia insist they are hopeful that a pathway to easing tensions could open during diplomatic talks set for January.But with less than two weeks to go before senior U.S. and Russian officials are to meet in Geneva, the chasm is deep and the prospect of finding an exit to the crisis faces no shortage of complications.Mr. Biden on Friday told reporters that he advised Mr. Putin when they spoke by phone a day earlier that the upcoming talks could only work if the Russian leader “deescalated, not escalated, the situation” in the days ahead.“I made it clear to President Putin that if he makes any more moves into Ukraine we will have severe sanctions,” Mr. Biden said. “We will increase our presence in Europe with NATO allies.”Meanwhile, Mr. Biden’s national security team on Friday turned their attention to preparation for the Geneva talks, set for January 9 and 10, to discuss the Russian massing of some 1,00,000 troops on its border with Ukraine.Mr. Biden is scheduled to speak by phone on Sunday with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday debriefed Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly, Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on the Biden-Putin call and discussed preparations for the upcoming summit.A top Putin aide on Friday reinforced that Russia stands by its demands for written security guarantees. Moscow wants it codified that any future expansion of NATO must exclude Ukraine and other former Soviet bloc countries and demands that the bloc remove offensive weaponry from countries in the Russian neighborhood.“We will not allow our initiatives to be drowned in endless discussions,” Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told the state RIA-Novosti news agency Friday.“If no constructive answer comes in a reasonable time and the West continues its aggressive course, Russia will have to take all necessary measures to maintain a strategic balance and remove unacceptable threats to our security,” he added.The Biden administration and NATO allies have made clear that the Russian demands are non-starters.Former envoys’ letterFollowing the Biden-Putin call, a group of 24 former U.S. national security officials and Russia experts — a group that includes several officials who served in the Obama, George W. Bush and Clinton’s administrations — released a statement calling on Mr. Biden to immediately, and publicly, lay out the penalties Russia would face if Mr. Putin were to move forward with military action.The Russians for their part continue to make the case that they are facing an existential threat with Ukraine.

Ukraine said on Saturday one of its soldiers was killed in fighting with pro-Moscow separatists, as the U.S. again warned Russia against any attacks on the country.In his New Year’s eve address, Mr. Zelensky said ending the war in the east remains his “main goal”.“One serviceman of the Joint Forces was fatally wounded,” the Army said in a statement.It also added that separatists had launched three attacks within 24 hours, using grenade launchers and small arms.The Army gave no further details of how the soldier was killed.Tensions with Moscow have soared in recent months, with Russia massing troops near Ukraine’s borders.The West has accused the Kremlin of planning an invasion.On December 22, international monitors said Russia and Ukraine had agreed to restore a ceasefire, but as early as the next day, Kiev and separatists accused each other of new violations. The soldier’s death on Saturday was the first since the truce was agreed.All previous ceasefires crumbled.Kiev has been battling a pro-Moscow insurgency in two breakaway regions bordering Russia since 2014, when the Kremlin annexed Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula.

China will end subsidies for electric and hybrid cars at the end of the year, authorities have announced, saying the strength of sales in the sector meant state support was no longer needed.In a statement published on Friday, the Ministry of Finance said purchase subsidies would be reduced by 30% from the beginning of 2022 before being scrapped completely by the end of the year.“Given the growth of the industry for vehicles with new energy, the sales trends and the smooth transition of manufacturers, the subsidies... will end on December 31,” the Ministry said.“Vehicles registered after December 31, 2022 will not be subsidised.”Sales of electric and hybrid cars have boomed in China, with increases of more than 100% year-on-year in recent months.The cars are set to represent 18% of all vehicle sales in 2022, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) estimated last week.

 Maldives and China
on Saturday signed key bilateral agreements during Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s visit, on developing and maintaining infrastructure in the Indian Ocean archipelago, besides agreeing on a visa-free travel arrangement for Maldivians intending to travel to China.
Mr. Wang arrived in Male on Friday, as part of his five-nation trip to Eritrea, Kenya, the island nation of Comoros, the Maldives and Sri Lanka. Maldivian Foreign Minister Abdulla Shahid and his Chinese counterpart unveiled a special official logo to mark 50 years of diplomatic relations between the countries. “For the past five decades, China has been an important partner in the socio-economic development of the Maldives, contributing immensely towards social housing, capacity building, infrastructure development, and tourism. I have no doubt that Maldives-China relations will rise to new heights under the able leadership of both President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, and President Xi Jinping,” Mr. Shahid said, at a press conference.A statement issued by the Maldivian Foreign Ministry said the visa-waiver agreement would allow Maldivians to travel to China on 30-day visa free basis once the pandemic restrictions are lifted. The two governments signed an agreement of ‘Economic and Technical Cooperation’ on grant aid, focusing on social, livelihood, and infrastructure projects. Further, the Government of Maldives signed a ‘Letter of Exchange’ on a ‘Feasibility Study of Management and Maintenance of China-Maldives Friendship Bridge’, for Chinese assistance in maintaining the 1.4-km bridge connecting capital Male with the island of Hulhumale.It was built with $200 million Chinese assistance during the term of former President Abdulla Yameen, whose government was close to Beijing. The bridge is considered China’s flagship project in the Maldives. Male owes Beijing about $1.4 billion from past loans, which President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih’s government has sought to “restructure”.China also agreed to back a sea-water desalination project and cooperate in the health sector, the Foreign Ministry said. Minister Wang’s visit would be one of “great significance to the future development of our bilateral relations”, Chinese Ambassador in Male Wang Lixin said in a tweet.Mr. Wang’s visit will be watched closely by New Delhi, which has maintained frequent contact with the Solih government that openly pursues an ‘India First’ foreign policy. Following regime change in Male in 2018, New Delhi committed $1.4 billion to development in the island nation that is home to about 5.5 lakh people.Mr. Wang’s visit also coincides with a growing ‘India Out’ campaign among sections within the Maldives that oppose “Indian military presence” in the country.

At least 22 people, including 10 children, died in a popular mountain resort town in Pakistan after being stuck in their vehicles overnight during a heavy snowstorm as temperatures plummeted, officials said on Saturday.Most of the victims died of hypothermia, officials said. Among them was an Islamabad police officer and seven other members of his family, fellow police officer Atiq Ahmed said.More than 4 feet of snow fell in the area of the Murree Hills resort overnight Friday and early Saturday, trapping thousands of cars on roadways, said Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed. The snow was so severe that heavy equipment brought in to clear it initially got stuck during the night, said Umar Maqbool, assistant commissioner for the town of Murree. Temperatures fell to minus 8 degrees Celsius.Officials called in paramilitary troops and a special military mountain unit to help. By late Saturday, thousands of vehicles had been pulled from the snow but more than a thousand were still stuck, Ahmed said.Most roads leading to the area’s resorts were largely cleared of snow by late Saturday, and military troops were working to clear the rest, Mr. Maqbool said. The military also converted army-run schools into relief camps where they provided shelter and food for the tourists who had been rescued.Emergency officials distributed food and blankets to people while they were trapped in their snowed-in vehicles, but many died of hypothermia. Others may have died from carbon monoxide poisoning after running their car heaters for long periods of time, said rescue services physician Abdur Rehman. As of late Saturday, the death toll included 10 men, 10 children and two women, Mr. Rehman said.In one instance, a husband and wife and their two children all died in their car. In another, four young friends died together, he said.Located 46 km north of Islamabad, Murree is a popular resort town that attracts well over a million tourists annually. Streets leading into the town are often blocked by snow in winter.

"he United Nations said on Saturday it would hold talks in Sudan aimed at salvaging a fragile democratic transition amid a grinding stalemate following an October coup and the prime minister's resignation last week.Volker Perthes, the UN envoy for Sudan, said in a statement the UN-facilitated political process would seek a “sustainable path forward towards democracy and peace” in the country. It wasn’t immediately clear when discussions might begin.“It is time to end the violence and enter into a constructive process. This process will be inclusive,” he said.Mr. Perthes said key players in Sudan, including the military, rebel groups, political parties and protest movements will be invited to take part in the process as well as civil society and women’s groups.There was no immediate comment from the pro-democracy movement or the military on the UN statement.The October 25 coup scuttled hopes of a peaceful transition to democracy in Sudan more than two years after a popular uprising forced the military overthrow of longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir and his Islamist government in April 2019.Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok resigned from office on January 2 citing a failure to reach a compromise between the generals and the country’s pro-democracy movement. He had been ousted in the coup only to be reinstated a month later following a deal with the military meant to calm tensions and anti-coup protests.But Mr. Hamdok resigned, plunging the country further into turmoil amid political deadlock and relentless street protests that have claimed the lives of at least 60 people since the coup.Mr. Perthes said repeated violence since the coup has deepened the mistrust of the military among political parties. He warned that the deadlock could push the country into further instability and “squander the important political, social and economic gains” since the uprising against al-Bashir.The protest movement insists that a civilian government lead the transition, a demand rejected by the generals who say power will be handed over only to an elected government. Elections are planned in July 2023.

Ethiopia will make any sacrifices to this end,” the government communications service said in a statement late Friday announcing the amnesty.There has been something of a pause in fighting since the TPLF retreat, although the rebels accuse the government of still carrying out deadly drone strikes on Tigray.Among those freed were several politicians rounded up after deadly protests erupted in mid-2020 over the killing of Hachalu Hundessa, a popular Oromo singer and activist.They included Eskinder Nega, a veteran Amhara journalist.

China said on Saturday it would begin implementing a strategic agreement with Iran, strengthening economic and political cooperation between the two countries as Beijing blasted Washington’s sanctions on Tehran.China and Iran signed the agreement last year after years of talks, with the wide-ranging partnership set to span areas including energy, security, infrastructure and communications.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir-Abdollahian announced the start of the partnership’s implementation at a meeting in east China’s Wuxi on Friday, Beijing’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

reported in 2020 that it would secure a regular supply of oil for China, citing a draft of the agreement leaked to the paper.
China is Iran’s leading trade partner and was one of the biggest buyers of the country’s oil before then-U.S. president Donald Trump reimposed sweeping unilateral sanctions in 2018.China has officially stopped importing oil from Iran, but analysts say Iranian crude is continuing to enter the country disguised as imports from other countries.Mr. Wang told his Iranian counterpart Friday that China would continue to “oppose illegal unilateral sanctions against Iran,” the Foreign Ministry said.Vienna talks under wayBeijing has long sought to boost ties with Tehran, with Chinese president Xi Jinping describing Iran as “China’s major partner in the Middle East” on a rare visit to the country in 2016.Mr. Wang and Mr. Amir-Abdollahian’s meeting comes as talks continue in Vienna over a potential deal to halt Tehran’s development of nuclear weapons.A 2015 deal — agreed by Iran, the U.S., China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany — offered Tehran sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme.But the U.S. withdrew from the agreement in 2018, reimposing biting sanctions and prompting Tehran to begin rolling back on its commitments.Talk to salvage the nuclear deal began in late November, after being suspended when Iran elected a new ultraconservative government in June.Mr. Wang told his Iranian counterpart on Friday that China believes the United States is to blame for the current state of the deal, the foreign ministry said in its statement.

U.S. intelligence officials have determined a Russian effort is under way to create a pretext for its troops to further invade Ukraine, and Moscow has already prepositioned operatives to conduct “a false-flag operation” in eastern Ukraine, according to the White House.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Friday the intelligence findings show Russia is also laying the groundwork through a social media disinformation campaign that frames Ukraine as an aggressor that has been preparing an imminent attack against Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine.Ms. Psaki charged that Russia has already dispatched operatives trained in urban warfare who could use explosives to carry out acts of sabotage against Russia’s own proxy forces — blaming the acts on Ukraine — if Russian President Vladimir Putin decides he wants to move forward with an invasion.“We are concerned that the Russian government is preparing for an invasion in Ukraine that may result in widespread human rights violations and war crimes should diplomacy fail to meet their objectives,” Ms. Psaki said.Pentagon spokesman John Kirby described the intelligence as “very credible.” A U.S. official, who was not authorised to comment on the intelligence and spoke on condition of anonymity, said much of it was gleaned from intercepted communications and observations of the movements of people.The U.S. intelligence findings, which were declassified and shared with U.S. allies before being made public, estimate that a military invasion could begin between mid-January and mid-February.Ukraine is also monitoring the potential use of disinformation by Russia.The new U.S. intelligence was unveiled after a series of talks between Russia and the U.S. and its Western allies this week in Europe aimed at heading off the escalating crisis made little progress.White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan on ThursdayRussia is laying the groundwork to invade under false pretenses should Mr. Putin decide to go that route. He said the Russians have been planning “sabotage activities and information operations” that accuse Ukraine of prepping for its own imminent attack against Russian forces in eastern Ukraine.Crimean parallelsHe said this is similar to what the Kremlin did in the lead-up to Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea.Meanwhile the Russians, while maintaining they don’t plan to invade Ukraine, are demanding that the U.S. and NATO provide written guarantees that the alliance will not expand eastward.Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned on Friday that Moscow wouldn’t wait indefinitely for the Western response, saying he expects the U.S. and NATO to provide a written answer next week.

International aid came to a sudden halt and the U.S. has frozen $9.5 billion in Afghan central bank assets held overseas.Hunger now threatens 23 million Afghans, or 55% of the population, says the UN.The Oslo visit from Sunday to Tuesday will be focussed on human rights and humanitarian aid as a poverty crisis deepens in Afghanistan. The hardline Islamists will meet Norwegian authorities and officials from a number of allied countries including Britain, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy and the U.S., the Norwegian Foreign Ministry statement said.The delegation is also expected to meet Afghans from civil society, including women leaders and journalists.“These meetings do not represent a legitimisation or recognition of the Taliban” Norwegian Foreign Minister Anniken Huitfeldt said Friday. “But we must talk to the de facto authorities in the country. We cannot allow the political situation to lead to an even worse humanitarian disaster.”The 15-member Taliban team represented by men, and led by Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, left Kabul on Saturday on a plane organised by the Norwegian government, a Taliban spokesman said.Ali Maisam Nazary, the foreign relations chief for the National Resistance Front (NRF) — an opposition group — condemned Norway over the talks.

Vietnamese monk-turned-peace-activist Thich Nhat Hanh, a hugely influential Buddhist credited with bringing mindfulness to the West, has died aged 95.The Zen master, whose reach within Buddhism is seen as second only to the Dalai Lama, spent nearly four decades in exile after being banished from his homeland for calling for an end to the Vietnam-American War.Thich Nhat Hanh “passed away peacefully” at the Tu Hieu Temple in the city of Hue, Vietnam’s Buddhist heartland, his Zen teaching organisation, the Plum Village Community of Engaged Buddhism, said.Before his return to Vietnam in 2018, he set up retreats around the world and wrote over 100 books including on mindfulness and meditation — a cornerstone of a $4.2 trillion global wellness industry espoused by Oprah Winfrey, Arianna Huffington and tech billionaire Marc Benioff.Born in 1926, Thich Nhat Hanh was ordained aged 16 and went on to found a youth school which trained volunteers to build clinics and infrastructure in villages blighted by war.In the early 1960s he travelled to the U.S., where he taught at Columbia and Princeton universities, but after one trip in 1966 to meet U.S. civil rights icon Martin Luther King — who joined his calls to end the Vietnam War — he was barred from returning home. Believing that war was fundamentally wrong, the monk refused to take sides in the conflict and was consequently persecuted by the governments of both North and South Vietnam.

"Dire straits: The biggest concern for students involve clinical subjects and learning surgery. File Photo

Two years on after thousands of Indian medical students saw their education in China abruptly put on hold amid the COVID-19 outbreak, students are still in the dark about when they can return and are growing increasingly desperate about their future. Students from half a dozen medical colleges in China, who have remained in India over the past two years, told
The Hindu
in interviews that they have been given no information about when they can return and that their online classes have left them unprepared as some face imminent graduation having missed out on practical training that is a crucial component of medical education.
 “Some of us are going to graduate with degrees that are only on paper, while we have wasted our family’s savings,” said one student enrolled in a college in Tianjin. The students
The Hindu
spoke to were all enrolled in the 45 universities authorised by China to offer MBBS degrees to foreign students taught in English. There are around 23,000 Indian medical students enrolled in Chinese programmes. The students interviewed are not being named as they were concerned about jeopardising their return to their universities.
In late January 2020, colleges across China closed amid the COVID-19 outbreak. Many students were in India during their winter holidays, and have remained in the country since. Others returned home as the outbreak spread, particularly those studying in Wuhan and in Hubei province, which is an important centre of medical teaching in China. India’s first confirmed COVID-19 case, on January 30, 2020, was a medical student from Kerala who returned from Wuhan.Online classesOver the past two years, students have had online classes which are used to teach theory, but clinical subjects remain untaught. Even a virtual theoretical education hasn’t been without hiccups. After the border crisis with China and the subsequent banning of 200 Chinese apps, students have to use sometimes unreliable virtual private network software to access apps where lectures are streamed. Most have to settle for subsequently downloading videos of lectures, which has meant little opportunity to interact with teachers.“We are slipping into depression,” said one student from Karnataka. “And I’m hearing this from all of my classmates. We face constant questioning from our family, who have helped us pay for this education, about how we are going to become doctors. It is a sense of humiliation for some of us, and we are just confining ourselves to our homes and have stopped socialising.”The biggest concern, students said, involved clinical subjects and learning surgery. The universities in China said they would restructure the curriculum to make up for the absence of practical learning when they return. But students who are graduating in the next two years are running out of time.“We have not even seen a cadaver,” said one student. “And the university’s plan, when we return to China, is for us to practice with a cadaver in the morning and then learn live surgeries in the evening. How is this even possible?”The question of returning to China itself remains uncertain two years into the pandemic. The universities say they have been given no timetable from the Chinese authorities on when they can issue letters needed for visa applications. Indian students have heard that some South Korean and Malaysian postgraduates have been given visas, but none so far from India. “The universities say it is not in their hands and the government has to give permission,” said one student.The students chose China to pursue their medical degrees after they were unable to either secure a highly competitive government seat in India or afford the exorbitant costs of a private education.Preferred destinationChina has gradually replaced Russia and Eastern Europe as a preferred destination, students said, because of a combination of factors: the costs, which vary across Chinese universities; the rapid improvement there in the quality of facilities; and the fact that a one-year internship, offered with the five-year degrees, is recognised in India.Students said those from China also generally fared better than many other foreign countries in clearing the challenging foreign medical graduate exam that foreign graduates are required to take, which in recent years has had a 15% pass rate.After two years of a challenging virtual education, the odds of passing that exam have only grown taller, while students still remain in the dark about when they may be able to return to their colleges and make up for the lost time.Asked about the plight of Indian students, the Chinese Foreign Ministry in November said the government “always attaches high importance to the issue of foreign students coming to China for their studies”.“On the basis of ensuring safety amid COVID-19, we will consider in a coordinated manner arrangement for allowing foreign students to return to China for their studies,” spokesperson Zhao Lijian said.That stand hasn’t changed, while China’s doors to the world still remain closed. For the students, a painful wait continues.

“When the Taliban offers you — a pregnant, unmarried woman — safe haven, you know your situation is messed up,” Ms. Bellis wrote in her column.New Zealand has managed to keep the spread of the virus to a minimum during the pandemic.But the nation’s requirement that even returning citizens spend 10 days isolating in quarantine hotels run by the military has led to a backlog of thousands of people wanting to return home vying for spots.She said she sent 59 documents to New Zealand authorities in Afghanistan but they rejected her application for an emergency return.Ms. Bellis said that pregnancy can be a death sentence in Afghanistan because of the poor state of maternity care and lack of surgical capabilities.

Hosting more than two dozen visiting world leaders in a banquet in Beijing on Saturday, China’s President Xi Jinping called for countries “to practice true multilateralism” and “uphold the international system centred on the United Nations”.Reading between the lines of the message, carefully couched in diplomatic language, was a thinly veiled criticism of the U.S., which China has accused, particularly in the wake of recently deteriorating relations, of practicing “hegemony” and undermining the UN-centred order. That message was conveyed recently in more explicit terms by the country’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who in his end-of-year review of China’s foreign policy contrasted Mr. Xi “pointing out unequivocally that there is but one international order, that is the international system with the UN at its core” with “a certain country’s interference in the internal affairs of other countries in the name of democracy and human rights, and the fabrication of false narratives of democracy versus authoritarianism”.The banquet for visiting leaders, which followed Friday’s opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics, was attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, five Central Asian Presidents, Singapore President Halimah Yacob, and Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan.The list of who wasn’t present was just as revealing. Ahead of the games, the U.S., U.K., Australia, Japan and Canada were among countries that announced a “diplomatic boycott” — their athletes are participating — citing China’s human rights violations in Xinjiang.India initially did not join the boycott and in November expressed support for the Games along with Russia following a meeting of the foreign ministers of Russia, India and China. That changed on Thursday when India said it would not send an official to attend the opening ceremony to protest China’s decision to select a PLA regiment commander involved in the June 15, 2020 Galwan Valley clash as one of the Olympic torchbearers.While China has hit out at the U.S. for “politicising” the Games, the event has at the same time offered for Beijing an important diplomatic platform, as Saturday’s banquet underlined, after two years of a pause in its diplomatic activity, which was limited to virtual engagements. Mr. Xi has not left China since mid-January 2020, when he visited Myanmar, and there have been no major incoming foreign visits until the Olympics this month. The Chinese state media highlighted that Mr. Putin was the first foreign leader to confirm his attendance at the Games, and the growing closeness in China-Russia ties has been in focus this week. On Friday, Mr. Xi and Mr. Putin in a lengthy joint statement that followed talks outlined a common position on a range of issues from human rights to attacking NATO’s “expansionism” in Europe and America’s Indo-Pacific strategy in Asia for having a “negative impact” on the region.

The U.S. State Department is waiving sanctions on Iran’s civilian nuclear programme in a technical step necessary to return to the 2015 nuclear agreement, a senior official said on Friday.The resumption of the waiver, ended by the Donald Trump administration in 2020, “would be essential to ensuring Iran’s swift compliance” if a new deal on controlling Tehran’s nuclear programme can be reached in talks in Vienna, the State Department official said.The waiver allows other countries and companies to participate in Iran’s civilian nuclear programme without triggering U.S. sanctions on them, in the name of promoting safety and non-proliferation.The civilian programme includes Iran’s increasing stockpiles of enriched uranium.“Absent this sanctions waiver, detailed technical discussions with third parties regarding disposition of stockpiles and other activities of nonproliferation value cannot take place,” the official said, insisting on anonymity.The Vienna talks, which include Iran, the United States, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, are at a key stage where the parties have to make “critical political decisions,” a senior U.S. official said last week.“The technical discussions facilitated by the waiver are necessary in the final weeks of Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) talks,” the State Department official said on Friday.The U.S. official insisted that the move was not “part of a quid pro quo,” as the partners in the JCPOA talks await Iran’s response .Not a sweeping measureState Department spokesman Ned Price insisted this U.S. step is a sanctions waiver for the civilian nuclear programme and not broader sanctions relief.Mr. Price wrote on Twitter: “We did NOT provide sanctions relief for Iran and WILL NOT until/unless Tehran returns to its commitments under the JCPOA. We did precisely what the last Administration did: permit our international partners to address growing nuclear nonproliferation and safety risks in Iran.”

"Fun avenues: Rebecca Luo, left, with skiers on the slopes near Beijing. Special Arrangement
Arona Huang, like most Chinese parents, had football and tennis lessons on the weekend schedule for her child.But the destination of choice now for her son Aaron, who is six, is the ski slopes in Beijing’s suburbs, one of dozens that have sprouted in the past five years as China prepared for the Winter Olympic Games, which began on Friday.When Beijing won the bid in 2015, the Chinese government saw both a pride project — securing the distinction of becoming the first city to host both the summer and winter games — and a massive sporting and commercial opportunity.China has never been a winter sport nation. In the past six years, however, there has been a more than 300% increase in the number of skating rinks. The country has in this time also added more than 250 new ski resorts, with the total number now crossing 800.Ms. Huang said skiing was previously the preserve of the rich, given the few options in China and the preference of the wealthy to usually head to Europe. That has now changed.After companies such as the firm where she works began organising annual retreats in ski — and not the usual beach — resorts, she enrolled her child in skiing winter camps. “A day on the slopes,” she said, “is now not much more than buying two tickets to see the Forbidden City”, costing a little over 100 Yuan (around Rs. 1,000) if you have your own equipment.During the COVID-19 pandemic, as China shut its doors to the world — which are still yet to open two years later with stringent travel restrictions — the usual huge outflow of international tourism was instead directed inwards. Among the service industries that capitalised the most, according to tourism data, were ski resorts, with more than 300 million trips in 2021-22 related to winter sports.China’s cold northeast, which receives plenty of snowfall, is home to many of the resorts. But closer to the arid capital, artificial snow is being used in towns like Chongli, which is hosting many of the events this month. Unlike for recreational activities which do not require heavy snowfall, there are strict standards and density requirements for the Olympics. Man-made snow had to be used in the previous two games in South Korea and Russia as well.That has triggered a debate about the environmental impact, with reports estimating that 49 million gallons of water will be used in a part of the country that suffers from water shortages.Organisers point out that is only a small fraction of daily water consumption in Beijing, accounting for less than 2% of the usage in Yanqing district, which is hosting events. In Chongli, the water demand for the games will account for a higher 10% of the normal usage. To mitigate that consumption, conduits have been built in Yanqing to direct the snowmelt to reservoirs, along with a new sewage treatment plant. That is less of a problem in the country’s northeast, in provinces like Jilin, or in Xinjiang in the far west, which is also on a resort-building spree, that receive heavy snow.Novelty and thrillsPart of the attraction for a new generation of winter sports enthusiasts is both the novelty of a new experience and the thrills involved, even if the expenses are higher, albeit decreasing, with the surfeit of new venues. “You have to overcome strong fear when pushing yourself to go down steeper slopes,” said Rebecca Luo, a national certified ski instructor. “But if you do, you find fulfillment.”She said this winter was the busiest by far of the past five seasons she has seen on the country’s slopes. But even after the glare of the Olympics subsides, skiers expect the crowds aren’t likely to thin. At least, that is what China’s latest booming industry is betting on.

Western leaders on Saturday said Russia and China were seeking to “replace the existing international rules” with their own order, as Beijing backed Moscow over its showdown with NATO.Russia has all but encircled Ukraine with its huge troop buildup and U.S. President Joe Biden has warned that Vladimir Putin plans an invasion within days.Moscow is using the threat to invade Ukraine to demand a halt to NATO expansion and what it calls “Cold War” ideologies.At a closely choreographed appearance in Beijing for the Winter Olympics, Mr. Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping had put up a united front against NATO expansion.“For the first time we now see Beijing joining Moscow in calling on NATO to stop admitting new members,” noted the alliance’s chief Jens Stoltenberg, speaking at the Munich Security Conference.‘Authoritarian model’“It is an attempt to control the fate of free nations, to rewrite the international rulebook and impose their own authoritarian models of governance,” he warned.EU chief Ursula von der Leyen had stronger words, accusing Moscow of a “blatant attempt” to rewrite the global order.Russia and China are seeking to “replace the existing international rules — they prefer the rule of the strongest to the rule of law, intimidation instead of self-determination,” she told the Munich conference.China has in recent years been in the crosshairs of the West over its human rights record, including its alleged abuse of Uighurs, which has also sparked a U.S.-led Western diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics.Speaking in Munich on Saturday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz warned against viewing the world through Cold War lenses, as he assessed that nations are no longer divided into a communist and a capitalist half since the 1990s.“There are now only capitalist countries on the globe, but North Korea. And if you see it like this, the difference between the states is about autocracy, about the way how we rule our countries, about democracy,” he said.“It is absolutely clear that we are going into a world that is multi-polar,” he said, adding that “you can be sure that other upcoming or already great nations of Asia will not accept” any attempts by China or Russia to build up their own spheres of domination or interest.“Not Korea, not Japan, not Vietnam, not Indonesia, not Malaysia,” he warned.

The chances of reviving the Iran nuclear accord are dwindling and the “moment of truth” has arrived for Tehran’s leadership, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Saturday.“We now have the chance to reach an agreement that will allow sanctions to be lifted. But if we do not succeed very quickly, the negotiations risk failing,” Mr. Scholz told the Munich Security Conference.“The Iranian leadership has a choice. Now is the moment of truth.”The 2015 Iran nuclear agreement had offered Tehran sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme, but the U.S. unilaterally withdrew in 2018.This in turn prompted Iran to start ramping up its nuclear activities.The outline of a new deal appears to be on the table in talks which have been held in Vienna since late November between signatories Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia — and the United States indirectly.A U.S. State Department spokesperson told
AFP on Thursday that “substantial progress has been made in the last week”.“If Iran shows seriousness, we can and should reach an understanding on mutual return to full implementation of the JCPOA within days,” the spokesperson said, using an acronym for the 2015 deal.But “anything much beyond that would put the possibility of return to the deal at grave risk,” the spokesperson added.Experts believe Iran is only a few weeks away from having enough fissile material to build a nuclear weapon — even if it would take several more complicated steps to create an actual bomb.",1,0,0,0
"Rare forte:For Vivek Mahbubani, humour has become a self-defence mechanism.Special Arrangement
One of stand-up comedian Vivek Mahbubani’s favourite bits in his routine is the one where he has an encounter with a Hong Kong policeman.He recalls how, in an experience that is sadly all-too-familiar for Hong Kong’s minorities, he is stopped yet again for a “random” search on the street. One cop mangles the pronunciation of his name as he checks his ID. As soon as they discover he isn’t foreigner but a Hongkonger fluent in Cantonese, the second cop immediately tries to recruit him, seeing a useful asset in “community outreach”.Beneath this seemingly simple tale is a layered and withering criticism of the discrimination that is rife in Hong Kong, an open secret that most of the majority is somehow oblivious of, yet is part of life for minorities.Most of Hong Kong’s 40,000-plus South Asians will have some story to tell of everyday indignities that they have become inured to, from being routinely stopped at the lobbies of their workplaces or apartments – the assumption is a South Asian entering a building is usually a deliveryman and couldn’t possibly be residing there – to hearing comments passed in Cantonese with the wrong assumption that a “foreigner” couldn’t understand the language.Then there are the “random” stops on the street.If it is an open secret, it is still a secret: discrimination faced by minorities, from South Asians to the many foreign domestic helpers many of whom come from the Philippines and Indonesia, remains rife, but a subject still remains on the margins.Mr. Mahbubani wants to change that. The experience of Indian-Hongkongers is a central theme in many of his routines, which he performs in both Cantonese and English.Born in Hong Kong to a mother from Mumbai and father from Kolkata, Mr. Mahbubani went to a local Chinese school. That gave him fluency in Cantonese, but also an acute sense of his identity and the complications that came with it.“In my whole year, there were maybe three non-Chinese,” he said. “I remember in my first year, another kid raised his hand and asked the teacher, ‘Why is there an alien in our class?’”Humour, he said, became a “self-defence mechanism”. He would respond to stereotypes with jokes.Growing up, his favourite comedians were American stand-ups Jerry Seinfeld and Chris Rock. In university in Hong Kong, Mr. Mahbubani started making notes for a career in stand-up that he thought would remain a a pipe-dream. Everyday life in Hong Kong, and his experience of being a minority, offered no shortage of material. “What speaking Cantonese gave me,” he said, “was that I got to enjoy Hong Kong from a very local point of view, some things foreigners might not get to see, while still not being Chinese. It is like living in two worlds.”A window to societyHe joked that “playing the dumb foreigner” can, on occasion, help – “if you’re caught jaywalking, for instance” — or offer a window to society, such as the instance where a bus-driver was taunting him with insults in Cantonese and then received the shock of his life when, getting off the bus, Mr. Mahbubani thanked him for the ride fluently.At a comedy competition in 2007, he dipped his toes in the waters of stand-up. He ended up winning the Cantonese competition (he won the English competition the following year). More gigs followed, as he juggled his job as a web developer with a passion for comedy, which is now his full-time occupation.Language, he said, has been the key “to breaking down the barrier”. “I joke that in Hong Kong, there are two ways to break the barrier. One, speak the language. Two, help people make money. You help people make money in Hong Kong, and they don’t care what colour your skin is.”Fifteen years on, Mr. Mahbubani feels there is more reflection on stereotypes that were once deeply ingrained. Yet, as the COVID-19 pandemic showed, there is far to go. Last year, a senior official in the Centre for Health Protection caused outrage after blaming South Asians for spreading COVID-19, prompting Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam to say “there is absolutely no suggestion of the spread of disease relating to race or ethnicity.”“What I hope to do,” Mr. Mahbubani said, “is that at the end of the evening after my set, a lot of the audience will hopefully leave with a different idea. I think they enjoy that I say out loud stuff they may have been thinking, but then joke about how ridiculous some of it is.”And all of this is done with a light touch — his aim isn’t to lecture. “For instance,” he said, “I joke about how people don’t sit next to me on the bus. And I say, ‘Do you guys think this is a bad thing? I love it. Please don’t sit next to me. I love the extra space, you know. ”

AFP , a major milestone for the controversial project.The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), set to be the largest hydroelectric scheme in Africa, has been at the centre of a regional dispute ever since Ethiopia broke ground there in 2011.“Tomorrow will be the first energy generation of the dam,” an Ethiopian government official said on Saturday.A second official confirmed the information. Both spoke on condition of anonymity because the development has not been officially announced.Downstream concernsEthiopia’s downstream neighbours Egypt and Sudan view the dam as a threat because of their dependence on Nile waters, while Addis Ababa deems it essential for its electrification and development.There was no immediate response from Cairo or Khartoum, which have been pressing Ethiopia to sign a binding agreement on the filling and operation of the dam ever since work first started.The three governments have held multiple rounds of talks. but so far there has been no sign of any breakthrough.The $4.2-billion (3.7-billion-euro) project is ultimately expected to produce more than 5,000 megawatts of electricity, more than doubling Ethiopia’s electricity output.

Scores of trucks left under the increasing pressure, raising authorities’ hopes for an end to the three-week protest against the country’s COVID-19 restrictions and the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.The street in front of Parliament Hill, the collection of government offices that includes the Parliament buildings, was the heart of the protests.“They are trying to push us all away,” said one protester, Jeremy Glass of Shelburne, Ontario, as authorities forced the crowds to move further from the Parliament building. “The main camp is seized now. We’re no longer in possession of it.”Canadian authorities also announced they had used emergency powers to seize 76 bank accounts connected to protesters, totaling roughly $3.2 million ($2.5 million U.S.).On Saturday, they also closed a bridge into the nation’s capital from Quebec to prevent a renewed influx of protesters.Police said protesters remained aggressive, and pepper spray had been used to protect officers.Around midday, protest organisers said they had ordered truckers to move away from Parliament Hill.“To move the trucks will require time,” organisers said. “We hope that (police) will show restraint.”

The Australian Defence Department said that a Chinese Navy ship fired a laser at one of its surveillance aircraft, putting the lives of the crew in danger.The incident happened on Thursday when the P-8A Poseidon plane detected a laser illuminating the aircraft while in flight over Australia’s northern approaches, the Department said.Such episodes are not uncommon as the U.S. and its allies accuse China of asserting its military might, and have taken steps to challenge Beijing’s growing clout in the western Pacific and elsewhere.The Department said in a statement on Saturday that the laser came from a People’s Liberation Army Navy vessel. It was accompanying another Chinese ship that transited through the Torres Strait. Both ships were now in the Coral Sea, east of Australia, it said.“Illumination of the aircraft by the Chinese vessel is a serious safety incident,” the Defense Department said.Lasers present a serious problem because when aimed at aircraft they can injure pilots or temporarily blind them — which can present safety risks particularly as they are taking off and landing.Past accusationsTwo years ago, the U.S. also accused the Chinese navy of firing a laser at one if its Poseidon planes over the Pacific. China denied it, saying the plane had circled at low altitude over its warship despite repeated warnings.In 2019, Australian navy helicopter pilots reported being were hit by lasers while exercising in the South China Sea, forcing them to land as a precaution.Tensions have ratcheted up particularly in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims almost in its entirety, while the U.S. and its allies insist on freedom of navigation in international waters.

"The chroniclerAbdulrazak Gurnah with his 2021 Nobel Prize for Literature diploma on December 6, 2021.AP
| Photo Credit: Matt Dunham
On October 7, 2021, Abdulrazak Gurnah got a call from the Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy 15 minutes before the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Literature was made. He half-thought he was being pranked. Gurnah was convinced only when he saw the news flashing that he has won the most prestigious literary prize for his “uncompromising and compassionate penetration of the effects of colonialism and the fates of the refugee in the gulf between cultures and continents.”Born in Zanzibar, an island off the coast of Tanzania, in 1948, Gurnah grew up looking at the docks from the window of his bedroom. He saw sailors and traders from Gujarat, Oman and Yemen make merry and money — “it was impossible not to know you were part of a wider world with its own centre of gravity,” he says.After the brutal revolution of 1964 in Zanzibar that led to the overthrow of the Arab government, the harbours became empty. Soon after, Gurnah left for England to study, and later, to teach as a professor of post-colonial literature at the University of Canterbury. He never traced back that journey. Today, he lives in Canterbury with a British passport. But his novels keep transcribing the distance between one home and the other, filled as they are with yearning for a place where one can
feel
free, even if one necessarily isn’t. In a Zoom interview, Gurnah talks about the guilt and gumption of being a post-colonial writer.
In your Nobel lecture, you spoke of how you began writing in your schooldays — “I wrote because I was instructed to write, and because I found such pleasure in the exercise.” Over the decades, as your relationship with writing changed, what has it done to the pleasure and innocence of the act?In my childhood I did not think what writing was for. It was the teacher asking us to tell something, and everybody would just sit quietly for an hour and see what comes. Always, something came. But when you are writing fiction, you are making something up, intended for someone you don’t know. You are speaking to the world, an unspecified audience, and so you’re crafting something that will, hopefully, be read forever.As to pleasure, I remember there was a time, not so long ago, when we would write long letters, intended just for one person. When you are writing or reading a letter, it is almost like that person is in front of you. You might laugh or smile at the jokes. There is something very intimate about that.Writing fiction, you are much more self-conscious about what it is that the words are doing and what you want them to do. The pleasure in writing fiction is in having an approach or an idea, and actually delivering it, conveying it with beauty — though not always successfully.Your sentences are spare. You don’t succumb to emotions easily. Is this a conscious choice? In
Afterlives
I wrote short sentences, but elsewhere I have written very long sentences. It depends on the kind of voice you are trying to generate, particularly if the voice is in the first person — whether the characters wants to speak directly or in a fuller, more mellifluous, poetic way. I think about my sentences, for sure, but I don’t necessarily torture them too much.
Your books read like testimonies. What is the relationship between testimony and literature? When does testimony become literature?There is a genre called testimony — mostly a Latin American form which is used for polemics. But there is another way of giving testimony, which is what I am interested in — to tell your story, something that has been suppressed, which needs to be revealed. I used this form in
The Last Gift
and
Gravel Heart,
where a father tries to explain to his son the meaning of certain events in the past. Here, it is not inviting judgement. It is a gesture, sometimes a gift, an attempt at explaining. This has a different tone. I am interested in how families are secretive about certain things — usually for what they think are good reasons. Sometimes these are quite big things, and they create something sad and sorrowful among family members.
 I remember a journalist talking to me about
The Last Gift —
where the father and mother keep their secrets from their children. She said that only when her mother died, she found out that she had one of those tattoos stamped on inmates of concentration camps. That is the kind of thing I am talking about.
You quoted D.H. Lawrence’s poem in your Nobel acceptance speech. Poetry is interspersed with your prose too. Why do you keep reaching out to poetry?I don’t always recognise the border between prose and poetry, to be honest. Sometimes, poetry is useful as a way of being intertextual — bringing in another text which enables a swift and complex connection, enlarging the idea you want to explore. It is a way of expressing how a person’s imagination works.There are often Indian-origin characters in your novels. What is your sense of India?My sense of India has always been comprehensive. The part of Zanzibar I grew up in had a large population of Indians — Hindus, Ismailis, Ithna’asharis, Bohras. They were shopkeepers, traders, builders and contractors. So I grew up with Indian boys, played hockey and cricket together, visited each other’s houses. This mixing wasn’t odd or exceptional — there were marriages sometimes, but not very often because of religious and other considerations that communities used to closed themselves in.After the revolution of 1964, there was panic because it targeted business and moneyed people. There was a great exodus of Indians. Many of those who didn’t leave were targeted. If you go to Zanzibar now you will find only a handful of Indians and empty streets where they used to live. Their influence, however, is still there in the architecture, in the food, in the Swahili that folded in various Hindi and Indian-language words. But the people themselves are not there any more.You have often spoken about the “miserliness” of European culture vis-à-vis the refugees it refuses to accept. Yet this is the culture you chose to live in. Your novels also have this uneasy relationship between the home you were born in and the home you later make for yourself. Is this tension something yourcharacters inherited from you?I would say it is one of the subjects I am deeply interested in. Partly because it is my experience. But what makes it so interesting is that it is the phenomenon of our times, where millions of people are in the same situation as I am in — not living in the same place one started from. Both these places — the absent and the actual one — have a vitality and a compelling engagement. As a subject, it is rich, full of possibilities. But of course, there is something tragic as well because of what a person loses in the process of being separated from people, or memories, or just the conviviality of a people who would understand you more fully than those in the place you are living.Is there guilt then, in writing about a culture you no longer physically inhabit?You mean, is there guilt about living away from your home? Of course, there is guilt. The guilt is to do with the people you have left behind, and how they are coping, and whether you are doing enough to help them. Perhaps the guilt is also that you are living among people who don’t need you. With time, you learn to live with it.Have you been able to read and write through this haze of fame?Since the announcement of the Nobel, I haven’t been doing anything other than talking to people like you (laughs).Is that a good or a bad thing?Well, for a while, it is unavoidable. It is global. It is wonderful. And if people want to know you or and hear you, that’s fine too.The writer is a critic with a weekly online newsletter titledprathyush.substack.comThe part of Zanzibar I grew up in had a large population of Indians — Hindus, Ismailis, Ithna’asharis, Bohras...

 At one place in her latest book
Ancient India: Culture of Contradictions
, Upinder Singh invokes “indulgent lovers in metropolitan cities inviting a backlash by the moral police who argue that this sort of celebration of love is against Indian culture.” It is such contemporary problems that have led Singh to explore, what is Indian culture? One of the results is unearthing, in the present book, some contradictions in ancient India.
Tensions in the past Singh’s historical accounts of ancient and medieval India examine who we are and how we got here. Singh teaches history at Ashoka University,and her main interest as a historian has been ancient Indian history and archaeology. Among several of her books on different themes in the area,
A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12thCentury
(2008) became a classic textbook for courses on Indian history, and her
Political Violence in Ancient India
(2017) tried to address the myth created about India having a non-violent culture at the time of building a modern independence movement on the principle of non-violence (ahimsa).
The present volume examines contradictions in ancient Indian civilisation, continuing her epistemic faith that ideas and attitudes in early Indian history are still discernible in India today, and therefore, why it is not only relevant but essential to study early India. Singh is not interested in “offering a detailed chronological history of ancient India, or rather South Asia. Instead, she has chosen a few themes that are central to understanding ancient Indian history, culture and thought, by focusing on the coexistence of certain radical tensions and oppositions — between social inequality and salvation, desire and detachment, goddesses and misogyny, violence and non-violence, and debate and conflict.”These tensions, arranged in five chapters, are illustrated with an informed understanding of primary sources and secondary sources including visual materials. The Introduction of the book invites readers to abandon simplistic stereotypes and try to grasp some complexities of Indian culture, and the Epilogue addresses the present state: in India, according to Singh, “it has become fashionable to talk about the ancient Indian tradition of debate and dissent and to present this as an inherent aspect of Indian culture and civilization. But we should not forget that participation in these was circumscribed by the unequal, hierarchical nature of social structures.” Drawing on textual resources including
Manusmriti
,
Mahabharata
,
Ramayana
, Jain and Buddhist texts, vachanas, Sangam literature, Vatsayana’s
Kamasutra
, Kalidasa’s
Raghuvamsa
, Sudraka’s
Mrichhakatika,
Kautilya’s
Arthashastra
, among others, Singh shows tensions, conflicts, complexities, rival philosophies and readings of texts in India. We also come across local traditions such as Virashaiva or Lingayat sect and Shramana cultures contributing to the making of counter cultures in Indian history.
 It is impossible to explore all practices and ideas that have contributed to the making of contradictions in the subcontinent, but one wonders at the absence of references to Sikhism, and also to the works of those who could be her interlocutors with regard to Hinduism such as Wendy Doniger, S.N. Balagangadhara and Manu V. Devadevan, whose
A Prehistory of Hinduism
(2016) is absent in the bibliography.
Theory and practice Singh tries to understand the complexity of Indian civilisation with the category of ‘contradiction’. She reads, for example, the
Manusmriti
as “a text that makes pro-women as well as misogynistic statements, and tries to explain the contradiction in terms of the gap between theory and practice; the juxtaposing of different opinions; the context in which the statements are made; and the point sought to be emphasised.” According to Singh, if Rama is an exemplar of virtues for some, in Periyar’s writing, he is a symbol of northern Aryan tyranny. Likewise, Singh reveals diametrically different views and practices coexisting in India.
Singh’s conceptual framework of contradiction follows a long tradition of historical analysis. To use Walter Benjamin’s formulation, “there is no document of civilisation which is not at the same time a document of barbarism.” All cultures involve power relations and resistance, and therefore tensions and contradictions are a given.A fine narrative What Singh has achieved in the volume is a cogent account of practices, ideas and religious traditions in India by interestingly arranging her material. Therefore,
Ancient India
provides an engaging sourcebook for Indian students and students of India Studies, combining different strands on Indian history, philosophy and culture. Singh offers the vignette of India’s past in lucid prose that does not obstruct the reader’s pace nor test their patience. It is indeed a fine narrative that gives the experience of reading the story of India.
 Further, Singh is pretty clear about the craft of a historian and the limits of writing history. For example, references to the
Mahabharata
and the
Ramayana
abound in her illustration, but she is aware of to what extent they can be considered as historical documents. Similarly, she is cautious about applying our present standards and norms retrospectively while reading ancient texts. If the past is a foreign country, Singh knows how to find her way within it, but her feet are firmly on contemporary India: she writes, “In ancient India, there were multiple religious communities, but no state religion. Perhaps there is a lesson for our own times.”

Ever since erstwhile champions of secular values have begun differentiating between Hindu and Hindutvawadi, a whole lot of intellectuals are bristling. They are arguing how these nuanced metaphysical differentiations hold no relevance on the street. Mostly from the Hindu elite, these are the same scholars who will argue that Islam should be separated from Islamism, and clarify that invaders of India should be described as Persianised Turks and not Muslim warlords.Religion as a word found favour in the 19th century. It referred to monotheistic mythology, which deemed god as a fact, despite the growing influence of science. For most colonisers, there was only one religion — their version of Christianity, either Catholic or Protestant. They saw Judaism as outdated and Islam as heresy, despite their common roots. Beliefs of the populations in the nations they colonised were deemed pagan and idolatrous, hence invalid, as superstitions and not religion.Then, however, it became difficult to access Japanese markets as the Emperor of Japan did not appreciate missionary activities. That is when the idea of ‘respecting other people’s religion’ gained political currency. In other words, in the 19th century, it was the market that forced Europeans to acknowledge the validity of multiple religions.Indian identityIt is not a coincidence, therefore, that during this period, Buddha was ‘discovered’ by Europe and widely appreciated. Indians were told that Buddhism was a better idea to emerge from India, a counter to casteist Hinduism. This is when words like Hinduism and Hindutva were invented, the former in the early 19th century by Raja Rammohan Roy who believed in social reform, and the latter in the late 19th century by Chandranath Basu who opposed social reform.Before this period, identity in India was based on caste, tribe, and region. One saw fishermen as belonging to the fisherman caste. It did not matter who they worshipped. Landlords were landlords — some Muslim, some Rajput, some Brahmin, some Thakur, some Kayastha.The British successfully formalised religion as a category through the medium of census. Hindus never had a centralised religion until the British told them they did. It was constructed as a creation of Brahmins to enforce caste hierarchy, just as prophets and priests enforced divine law in Christianity. This new vocabulary of religion enabled Britain to justify its rule of India, and ‘save’ Hindus from Muslim rulers, and ‘lower’ caste Hindus from the ‘upper’ caste elite. Later, it enabled elite Muslims to divide India and ‘protect’ Muslims from the now powerful Hindu elite. And it is now being used to ‘unite’ India from the so-called ‘Marxist’ anti-caste forces that want to divide Hindus, and hence India itself.Seen through the lens of religion, even pre-Partition India was a Hindu majority state. Seen through the lens of caste, India has always been a land of many minorities. Religion makes more sense than caste for the politician because democracy is based on numbers. As long as they were fighting elite Hindus, the Muslim politician could unite Muslim elites of North India to create Pakistan. But then the Bengali elite refused to bow to the Punjabi elite, and this led to the division of Pakistan and the creation of Bangladesh.Talking about casteThe fear of further division plagues both countries, for everyone knows the people of South Asia have strong caste and tribal roots, religion notwithstanding. However, both Pakistan and Bangladesh will resist conversations around caste in their respective Muslim communities, insisting caste is a Hindu and not a South Asian word. Academicians rarely push back despite vast evidence to the contrary.Is there anything Hindu outside of caste? If you do not talk about caste, a Hindu is accused of being an elite Hindu who uses privilege to deny caste. If a Hindu talks about caste, then they must only talk about it in terms of oppression and its annihilation. Any other conversation about caste, say, in terms of cultural and vocational diversity makes a Hindu a caste-admiring bigot. Thus, conversations are cleverly gagged to reinforce the idea that Hinduism is nothing but caste.Politicians never had a problem evoking caste, as it generates vote banks, and they can always justify it by appealing to minority rights. When it came to Islam, politicians could invoke religion and justify it by appealing to minority rights once again. But when it came to Hinduism, evoking religion did not really help. Other than Islamophobia, there was nothing really uniting Hindus.Powerful forceThe Mandal Commission changed that. It acknowledged that over 50% of Indian castes are actually backward communities, neither elite nor scheduled, neither savarna nor avarna. Hindutva became a powerful force when these backward communities were reminded of their caste histories, and made to feel proud of their Hindu heritage.This was the Hindutva masterstroke; it now speaks of Hinduism by speaking to the neglected middle of the bell curve of caste. At one end, hundreds of thousands of Indians have been told that they are being denied access to an institute or a job, not because of merit, but because their ancestors instituted and benefited from the caste hierarchy. They are paying for the crimes of their ancestors. It is social justice. Sounds rational and moral and ethical. But it does not take away the rage. It does not make you give up your caste, it makes you cling to it even more defiantly.At the other end, the academic assumption that the under-privileged castes want to give up caste is not based on fact. You cling to your caste identity to get that certificate that will give you access to education and a job. You may hide it to gain entry into elite circles. Considering the sheer size of India, not everyone benefits from the positive discrimination. There are still many without wealth and power and education who find solace in their caste identity, for that is the only family history they have. And Hindutva acknowledges it. Cynically, one might argue. But it is acknowledged nevertheless, winning the hearts of voters.Hindu vote banksCaste embarrassed elite Hindus. The idea of annihilating caste made many intellectuals feel morally superior just as annihilating religion made 19th century intellectuals feel morally superior, and annihilating gender makes 21st century intellectuals feel morally superior. But anti-caste movements seemed increasingly anti-Hindu, and by extension anti Hindu Rashtra hence anti-national. Meanwhile, Hindutva has successfully strengthened Hindu vote banks by acknowledging the reality of caste as well as the underlying Islamophobia and unabashedly equating it with nationalism.Most politicians now acknowledge that secularism does not win the heart of the Hindus who make up the largest vote share. They can sense a new vote bank emerging among those Hindus who do not identify themselves through Islamophobia or caste. As they go about creating this new vote bank, Hindutva ideologues are obviously alarmed. But so are secular intellectuals who had once granted themselves the exclusive privilege of defining Hinduism through the straitjacket of caste.

"Wild lifeAmerican zookeeper Jack Hanna was named one of the ‘50 Most Beautiful People’ byPeoplemagazine in 1996.hanna.com
| Photo Credit: copyright
1 Born on January 2, 1947, Jack Hanna, a zookeeper, was the former director of the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium. His many appearances on prime time TV with talk show hosts and a range of rare animals were responsible for the growth of zoo tourism in the U.S. His affable persona and relationship with animals started off on a local TV show that started in 1981, and later expanded across the world. What was the name of the show, which was a reference to a Biblical character who was supposed to have saved many animals in the Old Testament?2 These animals found in South America have three stomach compartments that allows them to consume lower quality, high cellulose foods which are usually found in the high altitude places they inhabit. One of the most characteristic behaviours of these animals is its ability to spit when angry. Depending on how angry they are they can reach further back into the stomach and spit more material. This is referred to in a humorous instance in a Tintin book where Captain Haddock gets into a spitting fight with one of these animals. What delightful sounding animals are these?3 These mammals have a unique form of social justice (thereby proving that it is not a unique characteristic of human beings). These animals drink half their weight in blood from cattle and horses every day. If one of them goes hungry, another will regurgitate up blood for the friend. If one hungry member goes to another and that animal refuses to help, the rest of the colony will then punish the selfish member when it can’t find any food by refusing to help it. Which species named after a mythical creature has this interesting system of justice? 4 The scientific name of this animal is
Boselaphus tragocamelus
. This translates to the very confusing ‘cow-horse goat-camel’. The common name comes from the fusion of the local words for a colour it can take on and the type of animal it was. What is the common name for this large Asian Antelope found anywhere from Himalayas to Mysore?
5 This beautiful animal has been revealed to be genetically linked to the tiger, but gets its name from another big cat. It is estimated that only around 7,000 of these animals remain. They have thick fur and wide paws to distribute their weight evenly and long tails which help them jump gracefully between rocky crevices. Unlike other big cats, this cat cannot roar and only hisses and mews. What lovely animal is this that can be seen in the Indian Himalayas or onscreen fighting pandas? 6 The common name for these mammals from the family
Manidae
comes from the Malay word for ‘something that rolls up’. They are the only known mammals who have protective keratin scales that cover their skin which unfortunately cannot help them against poaching by humans. These animals are highly endangered as they are the most trafficked in the world because of their meat and scales and are also endangered due to heavy loss of habitat. What are these unfortunate animals?
 7 There are seven tiger subspecies and their scientific name mostly all refer to the geographical area of incidence. Example,
amoyensis
(Amoy),
balinicus
(Bali),
sumatraensis
(sumatra) etc. Only one subspecies has a scientific name that honours an individual. That is the Indochinese tiger. To whom is the name dedicated?
8 This species split from its more prevalent cousin about 40 million years ago. The area they mainly inhabit gets its name from the Greek word for the animal and the antipodal region gets its name from the fact that this animal does not exist there. Currently numbering around 20,000 individuals, they are dwindling fast due to climate change as they need hard strong ice to carry their weight. What animals are these?9 This is a rare venomous mammal which hunts by tracking electrical signals like a shark. Because it has no teeth it uses gravel to break down food like a bird. When it was first discovered and taken for classification, the scientists thought it was a prank played on them. Its DNA shares genes with reptiles, birds and mammals, and recently it was discovered that it glows under UV light. What is this disorienting animal, which became more popular, thanks to a children’s TV series featuring one that is a secret agent?10 This animal was not known to the world till 1869, when the skin of one was studied with great interest. Every single one of the 2000 animals on the planet is from one country only. They have lived on Earth for millions of years and they almost got wiped out by humans in the last few decades. Unanimously described as ‘cute’, the collective noun for a group of these animals is ‘an embarrassment of ______’. What animal is this that adorns the logo for one of the biggest wildlife organisations in the world?A molecular biologist from Madurai, our quizmaster enjoys trivia and music, and is working on a rock ballad called ‘Coffee is a Drink, Kaapi is an Emotion’. @bertyashley

With such a straightforward title, what the reader expects is a Shonagachhi crime, and that is what the reader gets. To unravel the backstory to the deed, we are taken to South Asia’s largest red-light district with all its murk, heartbreak, violence and unexpected pockets of comfort. The protagonist Lalee is a sex worker who has managed to survive by repressing all memories of her past and adopting a carapace of indifference, under which simmers much anger. Lalee has a
babu
, an unlikely admirer and regular visitor by the name of Trilokeshwar ‘Tilu’ Shau, a man who “possessed all the charm of a leftover roti.” It is with him that Rijula Das chooses to start her story.
The first chapter is laugh-out-loud funny, with a less-than-charitable description of Tilu — a writer of penny eroticas who is in thrall to the city’s past. So deceptively witty is the beginning that the reader is lulled into thinking this is going to be a quirky thriller.But no. The story then dives into a darker place involving the usual suspects: a the merciless brothel owner, a faux-Russian hooker, some sweet young sex workers, an evil Maharaj and his acolytes, and cops who are reluctant to take up this particularly gruesome murder case because they think sex workers are low on the money-making chain. Within a few chapters though, Das blows the cops’ premise apart, showing us how sex workers can be found across Kolkata’s tony areas, hotels and parties, blurring the lines between ‘respectable’ and ‘disreputable.’ Das employs a measured pace; there is a restraint to her prose through which the pain of most of the characters (pimp and cop included) peeps through. And if the ending is pretty much
de rigueur
, if the female characters are better drawn than the male ones, that’s alright, because somewhere along the way, the reader has started rooting for Lalee and Co.
 Not quite a murder mystery, not quite a crime novel, more a pointillist story about a sex worker’s life,

 Kannada writer Vasudhendra caught the attention of the English-reading world with the translation of
Mohanaswamy
, his collection of short stories focused on the LGBTQIA+ community. The book, which marked his own coming out as a gay person, was preceded by over a dozen works in Kannada on various themes.
The Unforgiving City and Other Stories
offers us a peek into his larger oeuvre. The 12 stories in this collection, published between 2008 and 2017, are about characters caught in a fast-changing, fast-urbanising India. The manner in which identities are lost, gained or transformed in the process plays out here.
Quite predictably, Bengaluru and its IT workforce inhabit many of the stories. This is a world Vasudhendra knows up close, having been an IT professional before he decided to become a full-time writer and publisher. Here one encounters, for instance, a young woman who has to choose between the desire to be a mother and her corporate job; a family that finds new avenues in the city for their differently-abled son but at a cost; individuals or whole communities caught in the snare of social media, and more.Despite the book’s title drawing attention to the city-based stories, more gripping are the ones set in the smaller towns of North Karnataka. While the Bengaluru stories sometimes have a thinly veiled didactic tone, rendering the characters flat, those from beyond the metropolis are always unpredictable and quirky. The women of “Ambrosia”, “Broken Tumbler” and “Two Rupees”, for example, refuse to stay put in straitjackets.The most haunting story in the collection, “Red Parrot”, is set in Sandur in Ballari district, which happens to be Vasudhendra’s hometown. Once an idyllic small town, it shot to infamy after illegal iron ore mining ravaged its fertile, red soil to fill the pockets of the mining mafia and its political beneficiaries in the 2000s.The story, published in 2008, stands out for its rich detailing of the wrecked landscape, of people who manage to escape the town to build a life elsewhere and those who remain trapped. The very title of the story is a remarkable inversion of a childhood image that reveals the scale of environmental devastation in a flash.The Unforgiving City and Other StoriesPenguin Viking

The coronavirus epidemic has profoundly influenced humanity’s response to many things that seemed unimaginable. Think lockdowns, repeated tests for a virus, wearing masks, and a new vaccine within a year of the blight.In the pre-pandemic era, the default wisdom on vaccines was that they took a minimum of 10-15 years from concept to being available as a commercial product.Potential vaccine candidates have to be tested if they can destroy bacterial or virus cells in test tubes, then in small animals, large animals and finally, people.This is a three-stage process with phase-1 trials testing if healthy people inoculated with a vaccine produce the necessary antibodies, then it’s tested on small groups to see if those who get the vaccine are better protected than those who did not and finally, a similar process is repeated in thousands in hospitals across the country, or even internationally, to see if the protection holds. At every stage potential side-effects and adverse events are keenly watched — after all, the purported benefits cannot outweigh possible harm.A headstart There are reasons for the long gestation and seen in this light, to have several viable vaccines within a year of COVID-19 is a miracle of sorts.
Vaxxers
, by Sarah Gilbert and Catherine Green, is the “inside story” of how one of these vaccines, Oxford AstraZeneca, marketed as Covishield in India, was developed. Both scientists are part of the team at Oxford University that developed the vaccine. The book is a readable guide to the steps to developing vaccines. The authors, who alternate on chapters, highlight the challenges of adapting to a life of incessant scrutiny, the barrage of public interviews along with managing the daily grind of scientist life: writing grants, conducting experiments, managing laboratories.
However, the most important insights lie in how the Oxford vaccine got a headstart. Gilbert and her group were already working on designing vaccines against emerging pathogens.Pivotal momentThe 2014 outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in Guinea, West Africa, that killed nearly 11,000 people, is a pivotal moment in the quick development of a COVID-19 vaccine. Gilbert, a professor of vaccinology, was involved in the testing of an Ebola vaccine. “These experiences formed the foundations of what we’ve done… because of what happened with Ebola, learning what worked well and what did not, we were able to design, make and test a vaccine with unprecedented speed and with high levels of confidence in the outcome,” she writes.From the Ebola vaccine they got the idea to develop a vaccine that was a “replication-deficient recombinant simian adenoviral-vectored vaccine”.Novel approachAn adenovirus is a virus that easily infects human cells. Removing a single gene creates a form of the virus that still infects people but can’t replicate within the body. Unlike bacteria, viruses can only make more of themselves by taking over the replication machinery of cells. This excised gene is replaced with another which, once inside the body’s cells, instructs cells to make a particular protein against which the body’s immune system triggers a response.The resultant antibodies and the priming of the immune system against the proteins that characterise a particular virus then protect the person from a future live infection. The novelty of this approach is that the gene that is added can be either an Ebola virus gene, or a coronavirus gene or whatever infection is doing the rounds. While there are several alternate technologies to make vaccines, each has relative advantages and demerits. The book does not answer why in spite of such rapid development much of Africa has not been vaccinated even as other countries are already rolling out booster (third) doses as a new variant Omicron causes havoc. While much more will be written of this period in human history,
Vaxxers
will certainly be an integral part of this bibliography.

My six-year old grandniece was asked in her online class about her best friend. She promptly gave the name, but could not answer where the friend lived, her father’s name and other questions. The child was quick in responding to the last question, “Why do you like her?”“Because she is kind.”“What else?”“Isn’t kindness enough,” she retorted. The dialogue reminded me of my father who developed dementia later in life. Once, he suddenly asked me, “
Ammai
, who are you? Where are you from? You are talking to me so kindly.”
Kindness is well appreciated in the extremes of age and is an effective tool to blunt the thorns in life. If kindness is so good, why do kind people feel let down at times? Perhaps, it is because kindness is misconstrued by some as weakness or even taken for granted. If a kind act is acknowledged and reciprocated, the tender filament of relationships remains strong.The enlightened ones say, “Do good without any expectation,” but lesser mortals do feel good if their actions are noticed and appreciated.When some of my elderly patients rue about being alone and uncared for, I urge them to communicate explicitly with their children or relatives and friends. A desire to manage by themselves for as long as they could and not wanting to trouble children may lead to a lack of involvement, even if assistance is required.In the 1970s, when I moved to another city, I stayed in touch with my mother through long descriptive letters. Later, I switched to telephone calls, but my mother was not pleased. She would say, “I could read your letters repeatedly and feel your presence. Now, the moment I put the receiver down, you are gone.”In digital worldYet I could not bring myself to the old habit of writing letters. For the past 10 years, I am connected more than ever before with my tech-savvy relatives and long lost friends.But my 90-year-old mother has remained out of the frenzied digital world. She never complained and considered herself fortunate to be living with a caring son and his family. No technology can replace the tenderness with which she holds hands while squinting her eyes to identify the person and indulge in kind conversation. In this fast-paced materialistic world, will kindness and proximity survive? I hope they do. Recently as I was about to climb some steps, my grandson shouted, “
Paati
, wait. I will hold your hand.” He told his sister, “Paatiis getting old. She needs to be helped.” Much as I could walk without assistance and hate being called “old”, I didn’t want to snuff out the little angel’s innate desire to help.
Taking his little fingers in my hand, I resolved to be kind to “the kind”.vijayacardio@gmail.com

How do conflicts and the mass movements they trigger impact societies? The Goethe-Instituts in Kolkata and Dhaka launched a collaborative project in 2015 called ‘Inherited Memories’ to find out whether there was a ‘culture of remembrance’ in relation to the Partition of 1947 like the ‘Erinnerungskultur’ in Germany, and which traumas and memories were passed on from generation to generation. While the west (Punjab) did see memorialising, the east (Bengal region), which had witnessed two Partitions and a liberation war, deserved much more attention than it was given. That is the gap
Inherited Memories
seeks to fill, by talking to children and grandchildren of Partition refugees and understand how memory is “passed down, what is retained or lost, and how it is owned and shared by subsequent generations.” In the introduction, Firdous Azim says “these are the memories of third-generation descendants of migrants/ refugees, who have no direct experience of life before the 1947 Partition... The story they weave is complex, with many strands, where differences pertain not only to religion, but also to ethnicity and language.”
Identity battlesSince 1940 onwards, says Meghna Guhathakurta in her essay, the people of Bengal were caught in battles around the question of identity politics. “First, the movement for a nation that would be a safe haven for Muslims (Pakistan), and then the Language Movement for Bengalis that matured into the movement for an independent state. People in this region found themselves being hurled from one nationality to another within a span of four decades.” Some like Kazi Jahanara Islam, whose grandfather worked in the Air Force and was first in Pakistan and then came away to Bangladesh, rued the fact that because of the separation of two countries (India and Bangladesh), “an unexplained distance” crept into blood relations as well despite both being predominantly Bengali.Being positiveDolly Akter’s ancestors are from Bihar and she heard stories about Biharis who had moved to Bangladesh being called ‘razakars’ or people who have tortured Bengalis. In reality, she tells the interviewer, they were just inhabitants of Calcutta who had to move when the situation became volatile and it was a few years before East Pakistan became Bangladesh. She remembers her grandfather’s love for India though his father had to move to East Pakistan on a night when the long knives (or ‘da’) were out. He got separated from his sister in the process. Dolly likes to see the positive side of things, the fact that she can speak both Hindi and Urdu is an advantage, though her mother tongue is Bengali. “This has been possible because I’m a Bihari. Many feel shy disclosing their identity as Bihari [in Bangladesh], but I don’t feel that way.” But as Khaled Hussain, a campaigner for the citizenship rights of Biharis in Bangladesh, there is an underlying “sense of loss and dispossession” despite the “intensity of the struggle to belong to Bangladesh.”M. Haque “describes a life of easy movement,” right up to the 1990s, when one could go across the border to India and be back in Bangladesh the next day for breakfast. For Hindu Bengali migrants who moved from East to West Bengal, they passed on stories “full of nostalgia of pristine rural life, and accounts of greater prosperity.” What is the truth of these pasts? It lies, as Azim poignantly writes, in “what we hold in our memories, in the stories we tell each other.”Inherited Memories: Third Generation Perspectives on Partition in the EastZubaan

“Be nice to whites, they need you to rediscover their humanity,” said Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa at the height of the country’s anti-apartheid movement in 1984. A contemporary of Nelson Mandela, he too advocated a multi-racial democracy and fought alongside the former President in the nation’s decades-long struggle against racial segregation.

The Nobel Peace Prize awarded to him in 1984 was seen as a gesture of international support. As chair of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission set up after the fall of apartheid in 1996, Tutu stressed on ‘restorative justice’ in the spirit of the African philosophy ofubuntu, and praised survivors of violence who expressed forgiveness towards their perpetrators.

In 1948, C.B. Muthamma was the first woman to join the Indian Foreign Service. Three years later, Anna George was the first woman to join the Indian Administrative Service. Both women had to sign undertakings that they would quit if they chose to marry; but no such conditions were imposed on male officers.Years later, when Muthamma was passed over for a promotion as Ambassador, she challenged the discriminatory rule in the Supreme Court. She won in a landmark judgment. The order began by wondering “whether Articles 14 and 16 belong to myth or reality.” The last line was equally unforgettable: “We dismiss the petition, but not the problem.”Remarkable achievementsWhen Anna George was posted as subcollector to Hosur, she made history by bringing electricity to the border subdivision. She was also making history as a woman in a position of authority. Other women came to look at the rare sight. “She looks just like us,” said an old woman sceptically.The sexist service rule ensured that George would not marry her batchmate R.N. Malhotra until much later. Nevertheless, when Malhotra was appointed RBI Governor, entailing their move to Bombay, the government posted George to set up a modern port at Nhava Sheva. This was no “trailing spouse” appointment: in 1989, after setting up the port, George was awarded the Padma Bhushan. These women, and others after them, blazed powerful trails. In

Typically — because no one hesitates to make a sexist statement out loud — everyone wanted to know: how could a woman be given a Collectorship before her husband?Intrigued by the idea of a woman as Collector, Rajasthani women in ghoonghats (veils) walked across the sands to meet her. “We heard there was a woman Collector Sa in Bikaner, and came to see her for ourselves.”It was a challenging tenure. Anil supervised the digging of trenches as air raid shelters at home while Otima was out on patrols. When war broke out, and the Food Corporation of India godown manager fled with the keys, Otima literally broke the lock of the godown to distribute foodgrains and prevent hunger in the district.Eyes on the invisibleSibal writes about others who found ways to reach out to the marginalised who had hitherto been invisible to policy. Anuradha Gupta addressed the problem of exclusion by turning the focus of the polio immunisation campaign to children who had not been covered. B. Bhamathi issued a key advisory for cases of trafficked women and children from other countries who had been languishing in Indian jails for years.The most remarkable story Sibal tells is of Anita Kaul, a very unusual IAS officer. “Anita did not quite fit the idea of an archetypal bureaucrat. She was passionate about reforms, change and education. ‘Almost like an activist,’ a colleague had once sneered. To Anita, that was a beautiful compliment.”Anita was deeply involved in the design and implementation of many pathbreaking reforms: the total literacy campaigns, which regarded literacy as the people’s right, and brought civil society organisations and mass movements to partner with the state; the grassroots women’s empowerment work of Mahila Samakhya; the joyful, child-centred and world class pedagogy of Nali Kali; and the Right to Education Act 2009, which for the first time made free and compulsory education a justiciable right of the Indian child.It seems incredible that one person could impact so many lives — but Anita was relentless in her efforts to bring change. “Within the bureaucracy, Anita Kaul was known to possess the traits of an activist, and amongst the stakeholders and people at large, she was the medium through whom their issues would be heard and understood in the government circles. Once she decided to get something done, she would never give up.”Key to social justiceAnita Kaul believed that education was the key to achieving social justice and deepening democracy. She also believed that education had to face up to the reality of caste, gender and other disparities: “There is a complex caste-based exclusion we need to address in policymaking. We need to address the failure of the universalisation of primary education along with the complex socio-economic issues and the issue of systematic discrimination in which such failure is grounded.”Despite many challenges, public service continues to offer unique opportunities to drive social change. Sibal herself topped the civil service examination in 1986 and worked as Secretary to the Government of India. Her book reminds us that while women civil servants have contributed in extraordinary ways to nation-building and development, women in general are under-represented in the civil service, particularly at senior levels. This matters because the civil service must represent, understand and respond to the concerns of all those whom it serves.The reviewer is in the IAS.Views are personal.Women of Influence: Ten Extraordinary IAS CareersPenguin India

At the very start of this eminently readable biography of former prime minister V.P. Singh, author Debashish Mukerji states that the commemoration of this particular prime minister of India has not been a project of any political party otherwise engaged in a tussle on icons and their legacy. Not even a stamp has been released in V.P. Singh’s memory, a shocking oversight considering how his actions impacted the political and social history of contemporary India.While, as Mukerji states, it is obvious that the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress would have no interest since V.P. Singh managed to rile both the parties, it is surprising that Singh’s inheritors, the so-called ‘Mandalites’ like Mulayam Singh Yadav and Lalu Prasad Yadav, who headed governments in two of the most politically significant States in India — Uttar Pradesh and Bihar — have been strangely reluctant to invoke his legacy or mark it in any way.Astute politicianThe biography, intensely researched and undoubtedly enriched by Singh’s own recorded interviews for the archives of the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, provides a good picture of V.P. Singh as a person, who was a bit awkward in social interactions, part idealistic, part shrewd reader of political tea leaves. His early years, when he was adopted by the royal family of Manda, is lonely and leads to a problematic relationship with his father that persists through his life.Singh’s political enterprise, the Janata Dal party he helped found, and the National Front government he headed, was a conglomeration of strong personalities, with well documented fallouts among the main players.Behind the scenesAny biography of V.P. Singh has to deal with the whys and wherefores of the biggest decision he made as prime minister and one which has had a lasting impact on Indian politics — announcing the implementation of the recommendations of the Mandal Commission report.The book does not disappoint with regard to what went on behind the scenes of that decision, and presents interesting insights on how, even while high minded idealism may have propelled the decision, the timing of it was largely informed by the face-off between Singh and his colleague, former deputy prime minister in his government, Devi Lal.There are claims, on record by Singh’s then Cabinet colleague Sharad Yadav, that the final push for announcing the move came from him and a couple of others.The enduring mystery of course is why V.P. Singh, the author of the OBCfication of Indian politics and public life, never got enough credit for it or was not lauded even by those who built their political careers around Mandal politics.‘Friendship of porcupines’Some hints are given in the description of the way personal differences between various players in the once powerful socialist bloc of Indian politics came in the way of any consolidated political legacy being institutionalised. What former BJP ideologue K.N. Govindacharya once told me was the friendship of porcupines, of belonging to the same species but liable to sting with quills if theydrew too close. Whatever be the case, V.P. Singh’s own disillusionment and decision to retire despite the Supreme Court upholding his decision on the implementation of the Mandal Commission report (Mukerji quotes him as saying “I am like a rocket that burns away after putting the satellite in orbit”), put an end to his political career. He kept away from holding office even when the United Front government went looking for a prime ministerial face, hiding out till the choice finally evolved around then Karnataka Chief Minister H.D. Deve Gowda. His death during the Mumbai terror attacks of 2008 went largely without an eulogy or even an assessment of his legacy.Mukerji himself acknowledges that the book is an attempt to redress that lack, but here he is being modest. This life history of V.P. Singh also illuminates through its telling, how Indian politics was turned on its head, due to those brief months between 1989 and 1990.The Disruptor: How Vishwanath Pratap Singh Shook IndiaHarperCollins

"All in a dayLeopards are familiar with bright lights and big city.SGNP/ WCS/ Nikit Surve

The leopards of Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP), Mumbai, are “hardcore Mumbaikars,” says Nikit Surve. “Like me, they were born and raised here.” They are as used to bright lights and big city as the human residents.The 100-sq km park’s 40 to 45 leopard inhabitants dodge humans within their territory. You’d think nothing good ever happens when lots of people meet plenty of predators. But most folks rarely, if ever, see their shy animal neighbours, as they walk past Surve’s camera traps, often within a minute, of a razor-clawed cat.“Leopards jump off the road and hide in bushes when people come by,” says Surve. “And when the coast is clear, get back to their business. They definitely see us more often than we see them.”In tiger reserves, several safari jeeps, laden with raucous tourists, corral tigers, which seem bored with the celebrity-worthy attention. Such a situation would never arise with a leopard, says the researcher. Their shy nature is one factor that enables them to thrive in the metropolis. Their resilience, a trait they share with their fellow citizens, is another.Can human Mumbaikars adjust to the situation as leopards do? At one time more than a decade ago, that seemed impossible. Many encounters resulted in injuries and deaths on both sides. Residents demanded the removal of leopards while conservationists wanted people to be evicted.“Removing leopards is a short-term solution,” says Surve. “If you don’t remove the cause [of their presence], leopards will continue to return.”Resident catsThe sylvan grounds offer plentiful prey, round the clock security, and proximity to others of their kind living in neighbouring forests to the east, key criteria conducive for leopard occupancy.The park management started a collaborative programme called ‘Mumbaikars for SGNP’ (See ‘Predator on Our Porch’, October 27, 2017) involving the public, police, media, and researchers such as Surve.“It took seven to eight years for the programme to pay off,” he says. “Now the city has also accepted leopards as fellow Mumbaikars.”When leopards stride along compound walls or sprawl on ledges, people have learned to keep their cool. Residents, including celebrities such as actor Siddharth Chandekar, whose apartments overlook the park, have turned fans, posting photos of the cats on social media and gushing about the feline beauties.The Warli adivasis and other communities living in flimsy shacks within the park don’t have the advantage of safety by distance, living alongside these predators. One family had the fright of their lives when a leopard crash-landed inside their hut. A woman was cooking dinner in the kitchen when she heard a commotion in the other room where her two children were completing their homework. The 50-kilogram cat dangled from the ceiling fan, which luckily, wasn’t working. It had been stalking rodents on the rickety roof when it gave way. The inhabitants ran outside while the leopard charged out minutes later. The frightened predator didn’t return again in more than two months of camera trapping.Icons aroundThe indigenous community worships Waghoba or Waghdevi, a deity of large cats represented by the striped avatar of a tiger or the spotted pattern of a leopard. About 50 such icons adorn the park, evidence that human interaction with the animal world takes different forms.This bonhomie didn’t prevent leopards from sneaking into the city surrounding the park. Were they unable to find food? After studying the wild prey of the park, Surve concluded there were ample deer to keep the leopards sated.“It’s down to the cost-benefit ratio,” he says. “Rather than chasing after a deer, they prefer snatching a stray dog.”One dog can feed a leopard for five to seven days.“There’s a hawker selling vada pav every 300 metres in the streets of Mumbai,” he says, referring to a popular burger-like snack with spicy fried potato filling. “Dogs are as easily available along the periphery of the park.”Like their human counterparts, leopards have adopted the ease of city life: street food.

"Scientist and fiction-writer Indira Chandrasekhar is founder-editor of the online literary magazine
Out of Print
, which celebrated its tenth anniversary in December 2020. The occasion was marked with the publication of
Out of Print — Ten Years: An Anthology of Stories,
which showcased some of the best works of short fiction that have appeared in the magazine over the years. The book didn’t get the attention it deserved as the pandemic intervened. Chandrasekhar is the author of
Polymorphism: Stories,
published in 2017
.
She has been associated with the G5A Foundation for Contemporary Culture, a non-profit focusing on experimental contemporary art, since its inception. In this interview, she explains what
Out of Print
means to her. Excerpts:
What prompted you to startOut of Print? At the time we started
Out of Print
, I was beginning to write fiction seriously myself and discovered that there were few spaces in India for publishing short stories, and almost no online platforms. The latter bring such immediacy and reach, which create a certain energy in itself. I felt a burst of conviction that we would be able to start and sustain an online magazine for short fiction and I just plunged in.
The submission guidelines forOut of Printspecify that the stories need to have a connection with the Indian subcontinent. How do you define this connection?We don’t have a set of rules for this. It is usually self-evident, emerging from geography, character, narrative... However, what it means in a deeper sense is something more elusive and less easily explained. Perhaps one way to grasp that connection is to read the anthology, with its many stories and nuanced realities.What are some of the other parameters for selection in your publication? Wearedrawn to works that have an inherent integrity, a lack of self-consciousness, an exploration of complex human emotions and relationships. They should have those “shadowy links that connect us to other people, to our pasts,” as Shashi Deshpande puts it in her essay, ‘Why Read?’ (
Subversions: Essays on Life and Literature).
And, if I may add, to our imagined futures and to our places in the universe.
Is running an online literary magazine different from running a print one? The chief difference in the two media lies in the post-edit process. I have not run a print magazine, but in bringing out
Pangea: An Anthology of Stories from Around the Globe
(2012),
Polymorphism
and the
Out of Print
anthology, I have experienced the limitations that a physical page imposes that are not there in the online format. The writer need not be careful of the word count when writing for online publications.
Can you list some short stories that have stayed with you? Why are they unforgettable? Some remarkable things have stood out — stories that have found new futures after being published in
Out of Print,
like the ones that initially appeared in a Lahore newspaper and in a higher-education textbook on English writing in Norway; stories by exciting new writers whom we develop, who go on to have notable writing careers; translations that bring works from other languages to a new audience. Even some stories we have not featured but which have stayed with me and moved me — like lost children, they stay with you forever.
What is the targeted readership ofOut of Print? Is the short story getting enough love from readers, in your opinion?How can it not? It is such a fine form — concise, succinct, essential, yet revealing the complexities of love, happiness, loneliness and isolations. Place, history, tradition, family can all be explored with a sharp focus.We do not really target any specific readers. We simply offer the work to any reader, and our readership widens, which is most gratifying as it shows that there is a continuing need for us to know who we are as people, as communities, as societies, through our stories.The interviewer is the author ofA Happy Place and Other Stories.We do not really target any specific readers.

 As visual media hijack shrinking attention spans, modern-day writers, forced to compete for survival, opt for motion-picture-like storytelling formats with a jackrabbiting cadence. Gautam Bhatia steers clear of the pitfall this poses for literature — in
The Horizon
, sequel to
The Wall
, he eases new readers into the complex universe of
The Chronicles of Sumer
through a narrative full of gravitas and a charismatic kind of solipsism. The layered story unfolds at a pacy gait underpinned by a cinematic feel and lively repartee between characters.
The series has the usual tropes of speculative fiction (SF) — revolutionism, sociopolitical churn, allegory, world-building (including etymologically-sound nomenclature and other markers of a historied fictional civilisation), alchemy, metaphysics. A quick synopsis: Sumer, a walled and self-contained city, is a strictly controlled pre-industrial society stratified by labour and governed by propaganda, which is reinforced by strong-arm methods and preserved through secrecy. Its citizens consist of a conservative faction intent on maintaining the status quo; a group of radical idealists determined to remake their world; and a general populace too busy fulfilling its duties to be of any relevance to the narrative. Just like our world.Within the broad category of SF, the book is versatile in its scope in terms of genre and tone. Providing chills and thrills are action-packed battle scenes, stunts and dynamic PoV sequences; the solace of poetry is available almost at every turn of the page; philosophical arguments over social and civic reform serve as a throwback to the Greek agorae that birthed the Socratic method and promoted democratic discourse; emotionally-charged relationships frayed by the intensity of their bonds add spice and make the characters relatable; strategic machinations, fluctuating allegiances, inscrutable motives keep readers on their toes; scientifically plausible alchemical magic punctuates depictions of warped reality to remind us that it is a fantasy novel after all. At times, the dialogues strike you as overly self-indulgent and self-important before you remember the high stakes involved.Scoring highThe very purpose of SF is to reimagine the workings of the real world through the prism of alternative realities, wherein the author and readers can together engage in thought experiments and dissect their ramifications in the safety of a hypothetical environment. The book scores high on this front. Past literary works and historical archetypes lend credibility and a frame of reference to any SF work — the challenge for writers is to decide on the degree of intertextuality and eclecticism. But Bhatia has painstakingly constructed an intricate and cogent world in its own right. Bhatia himself lists the bibliographical references used in the novel. The series also seems to draw inspiration from venerable works of SF — in the idea of venturing beyond the perimeter of the known world to transcend one’s existential binds, there’s a parallel to
The Truman Show
; in the idea of martyring oneself to save one’s people, there’s a link to what drove the cosmonauts in Christopher Nolan’s
Interstellar
; the medieval cityscape governed by an elite power centre is reminiscent of King’s Landing from
Game of Thrones
(including a shout-out disguised as battle cry, “For the Wall!”). The scenes of vociferous debates among Sumer’s policymakers trading barbs and biases pay direct homage to the sessions regularly telecast on Sansad TV.
Have you ever wondered about the boundary between Being and Nothingness? The immutable wall of Sumer sheltering and sequestering its inhabitants from the unknown world beyond serves as an exciting microcosm of this idea. If the axiom of Time can be viewed as an emergent construct (the poets of Sumer seem to reimagine it as an architectural feature manufactured by the divine ‘Builders’ and subject to collapse as such), the notion of Nothingness can be conceived and befriended. That’s a nice piece of metaphysics to chew on and a worthy distraction from all the earthly bickering that goes on, on this side of the wall.The HorizonHarperCollins IndiaThe layered story unfolds at a pacy gait underpinned by a cinematic feel and lively repartee between characters

A Moveable Feast: Life-changing Food Adventures Around the World
. This

publication takes you to distant lands and food, through the eyes and words of some remarkable writers.
Take the opening lines of Pico Iyer’s essay, ‘Daily bread’. He is in a Benedictine hermitage in California. “The quiche is as soft as hope itself, and the long spears of asparagus are so elegant on the plate that to pick one up feels like messing with the symmetry of a Klee. There are bowls of lettuce in our midst, and the chunky vegetable soup alone would make for a hearty meal. Bottles of salad dressing crowd the blond-wood table, large enough for six of us, while early-spring sunlight streams into the window-filled refectory, so that it feels as if we’re tasting radiance and taking a long draught of the sun.”Each chapter is a beautifully crafted essay that looks at people, food, culture and memories. And some of the recollections are not just about food but also about circumstances in which it was consumed.Curiously relaxing“Like most of us, I enjoy eating while actually in motion,” writes author Jan Morris. “An Indian curry is best of all when it has been thrust urgently through your compartment window at Hooghly Station the very moment before your great train leaves for Mumbai.” She recalls boarding the “last frail remnant” of the Orient Express, where she was handed a paper bag containing an apple, cheese and half a bottle of excellent white wine — “what could be a better munch while we laboured across Europe?”There is something curiously relaxing about these dream-like chapters. You are locked indoors, thanks to a seemingly unsquashable virus, but see yourself in the Italian Riviera with American author and journalist David Downie. He stands in front of a vegetable patch that has been destroyed by boars and watches the farmer snip off, one after the other, the damaged plants. “He rummaged among the artichokes, snipping and yanking, before turning to a lemon tree hung with yellow orbs. Soon the basket was bursting, its contents carefully arranged. He handed it up to us.”Little asidesI then find myself in French Guiana with journalist-author Mark Kurlansky, as he recalls his favourite restaurant in Cayenne. “It specialised in the game of the forest: gamey little agoutis, succulent tapir stews, an occasional python or an iguana, foods you can’t get in many places... I couldn’t understand why everyone else wasn’t eating there too... Instead, they crowded into French restaurants to eat northern foods ill-suited to the tropics, sweaty pâtés and gloppy sauces that languished in the heat — and later in your stomach. Well, I concluded, that is what the French are like — as with most cultures with good cuisines, completely hung up on their own.”It’s the subtext — such as the little aside about cuisine snobbery — that makes this book so very readable. The link between food and culture is the thread running through the essay, ‘Cooking with Donna’, by travel editor William Sertl too. He is in a luxurious Caribbean estate and has just been handed an elegant bell that he must ring for the next course.“At first, I laughed, without meaning to. Then I baulked, and stood up, pushed my chair under the table and marched directly into the uncharted territory of the kitchen. Donna was stirring the contents of a pot on the stove. I approached, picked up the lid, and said, ‘What’s for dinner?’”Food, he holds, is the key to culture — “the easiest way into a relationship with folks you’ve yet to meet”. Especially, I would add, food that you still have to try out (python, anyone?) and journeys you still have to make.You are locked indoors, thanks to a seemingly unsquashable virus, but see yourself in the Italian Rivi",0,0,0,1

1 On January 9, 1960, President of Egypt Gamal Abdel Nasser opened the construction on Aswan Dam by detonating 10 tonnes of dynamite on river Nile. Since this dam would deluge a valley, which was home to the Abu Simbel temples, an international organisation launched a campaign that resulted in the Abu Simbel and Philae temples being taken apart, moved to a higher location, and put back together piece by piece. The success of this effort led to the campaign becoming a global movement to safeguard cultural heritage. What campaign is this that protects 40 such sites in India?2 The Three Gorges Hydroelectric dam retains an amount of water with a surface area of 1,036 sq. km., extending 600 km upstream. The water weighs more than 39 trillion kg, now raised 175 m above sea level. A shift in a mass of that size impacts the rotation of the Earth due to a phenomenon known as ‘the moment of inertia’, and thus slows its rotation. NASA says the shift of such a mass will increase the length of day by about 0.06 microseconds, and shift the pole position by about two centimetres. In which country, and across which river is this massive dam?3 The Qattinah Barrage or Lake Homs Dam located in Syria, was constructed during the reign of the Egyptian Pharaoh, Sethi, between 1319-1304 BC. The 2 km long masonry gravity dam impounds Orontes river and creates Lake Homs, which holds 200 million cubic metres and supplies water to the city of Homs through canals to this day. What record does this dam hold?4 The Kallanai dam was constructed by King Karikala Chola of the Chola Dynasty in the 2nd century AD. Also known as Grand Anicut, it is the fourth oldest still functional dam in the world and provides water for the irrigation of one million acres of land along the Delta region. The river on which it is built splits in two just 30 km upstream where Srirangam is found. Downstream from the dam, the river splits into four streams. Which river is this on which the Kallanai dam is built?5 Arch Dams consist of a curved arch supported by the walls of the canyon in which they are built. It is designed so that the force of the water presses against the arch, causing the arch to straighten slightly, and strengthening the structure as it pushes into its foundation. One of the earliest of these is the Kebar Dam in Iran which is 26m tall and built in 1300 AD. Which empire, which was the largest contiguous land empire in history, built this engineering marvel during the peak of its powers?6 The Boulder Dam in Arizona, when built in 1936, was both the world’s largest concrete structure and largest hydroelectric power station. It is 726 feet tall, has a base 660 feet thick and was built to last 2,000 years. The concrete in it will not even be fully cured for another 500 years. Constructed during the Great Depression it was later named after the President who passed the bill for it in Congress. What is the name of this massive dam you would have seen in many movies?7 The Jinping-I Dam is a arch dam on Yalong river in Sichuan, China. It powers a hydroelectric station that produces 18 TW·h (billion kW·h) annually. The reason it produces such a high amount of power is because of the elevation drop of 310m. What record does this dam hold?8 The Contra Dam in Switzerland is a slender concrete arch dam standing at a height of 722 feet. It has a slender design that reduced construction costs. Located in the beautiful Val Verzasca valley, it has become a huge tourist attraction after a stuntman did a bungee jump in 1995. This stunt, voted the ‘best movie stunt of all time’, was part of the debut of Pierce Brosnan as James Bond. Which movie is this, now used to refer to this dam as well?9 The Gordon Dam is an arch dam located in southwest Tasmania in Australia, with an amazing feature that allows it to resist large hydraulic pressures coming from the 12,359,040 megalitres of water in Lake Gordon, the largest lake in Australia. The dam generates 13% of all electricity in Tasmania, thanks to an underground power station. Technically known as a ‘double curvature’, what is special about this arch dam?10 The Tarbela Dam is an amazing piece of engineering as it is the largest earth-filled dam in the world. The main dam wall stretches almost 9000 ft and stands 486 ft high. The reservoir formed has a surface area of 250 square kilometres. The dam was designed to use water from a certain rover as a means of flood control and generation of hydroelectric power.

Nearly six decades ago, a professor in a Walt Disney comedy bequeathed immortality to a mental failing that has been a recurring cause of red faces. The professor was bright and brainy but so single-mindedly focused on high matters of science that he could never remember the more mundane “asides” of life — including his forthcoming wedding. The
Absent-Minded Professor
may have been a laugh riot, but absent-mindedness is no laughing matter.
At work, if you misplace a file or stand up to make a presentation only to realise that your notes are in the drawer at home, you will be deemed slack and clearly unfit for what HR departments describe as “higher responsibilities”.Present day society with its fetish about practical efficiency does not readily forgive us — the serial forgetters. Word goes around that our memory has more holes than a mosquito net. The extended family will then stand on the sidelines and snigger while the spouse, out of wifely concern, suggests consulting the friendly, neighbourhood neurologist, just in case it’s an early warning sign of dementia. Relax, it’s nothing of the sort.Listen to the experts. George Grossberg, Director of Geriatric Psychology at the St. Louis University School of Medicine, says: “Someone who misplaces his keys, gets frustrated, and runs around looking for them is (just) absent-minded. On the other hand, a person who misplaces his/her keys, doesn’t know that they are lost, and after they are found, forgets what they are for, that’s cause for concern.” If you haven’t gone that far, you are in safe territory. We of the forgetful fraternity also have historian-cum-philosopher Yuval Noah Harari on our side. He says that the human mind is not designed to “think like a filing cabinet”. A normal mind does not move like a regiment on parade. Rather, like a Jaspreet Bumrah run-up, our line of thought hops, stops, and pops as memory surrenders to our poet-like imagination.There are many ways of polishing a rusty memory. These range from regular meditation to de-clutter your top storey to eating brain food like almonds every morning. If you tend to forget the names of people you have met, you are told to repeat the name under your breath till your mind has got it pat. More discretion is advised. Suppose you are repeating ‘Rooprani’, make sure your wife is not within earshot.If none of this works, do not despair. Not everything in this world is of lasting significance. Why carry around the burden of unpleasant remembrances or the overhang of guilt? As Khalil Gibran said: “Forgetfulness is a form of freedom.”jairam.menon@gmail.com

My countenance is neither attractive nor photogenic. Therefore, I always try to evade group photos with friends or relatives. But when the situation cannot be skipped in any way, I position myself in the neglected zone in the rearmost line when others compete for the front rows.However, on one occasion, a photograph of mine left me in bliss. It was January 1993. I was then a regular reader of a magazine published from New Delhi. It held an essay contest asking the participants to send their entries with a passport-size black & white half-bust photograph by post.Frantic effortThe essays of the first two winners would get published with their photographs. Only the photographs of the next 16 “highly commendable contributors” would be published with their names and those of their districts or towns. The topic of the essay was “Future of democracy in India”. I decided to participate and wrote and rewrote every sentence with intense care. Page after page was wasted. I can still remember that I started my essay with the Latin phrase on democracy
vox populi, vox dei
.
I finished the essay and jotted it down neat and clean on one side of paper with a fountain pen gifted to me by my father on my birthday. The pages with a short biodata and photograph were put in a brown envelope and sent to the magazine.After the harrowing process for days, I heaved a sigh of relief. The thought of the essay lingered for a few more days in my head. The process of editing and re-editing continued in my mind, though of no use. Many new thoughts, sentences, phrases, idioms and words that eluded me before sending the essay sprang up in my mind now. However, the whole matter disappeared from my head gradually.In January 1993, the special number manifested.Paying little attention even to the cover page, I turned over to the pages where the winning essays were published. To my utter disappointment, my essay was not adjudged for the first two positions. One from Kerala stood first and another from Indore second.Then I turned to the next page reluctantly to see whether I was selected as a “highly commendable contributor”. I felt fortunate when I found that my photo was published and my essay got the third position. My regret doubled as I missed the chance of getting my essay published, thinking a little more effort would have realised my dream.However, I was extremely elated to find my photo in a magazine. After a month, the postman delivered a large envelope to my address sent by the publisher.My nimble fingers tore open the envelope hurriedly to find the certificate for my essay. I spent many hours gazing at my photo. It was my first photo to which I felt a narcissistic attachment.nandi.budha@gmail.com

"oday’s deal is from a team competition some years ago. Both tables reached four hearts and both West players led the five of diamonds. Paths diverged from there.At one table, East won the ace of diamonds at trick one and shifted to the nine of clubs to the queen and king. Declarer ducked in dummy and won the jack of clubs continuation with dummy’s ace.South cashed dummy’s ace of hearts and led a heart, rising with his king when East showed out. He then led the jack of hearts to West’s queen. That was it for the defense and declarer had 10 tricks and his contract.At the other table, East ducked his ace at trick one. South won and played hearts the same way – ace, king, and jack to West’s queen. West led his remaining diamond to East’s ace and ruffed the diamond return. He exited with the queen of spades to South’s ace. There were not enough entries to develop a spade trick and South drifted down one from there.South could have run the jack of hearts at trick two, extracting all of West’s low trumps before giving him the queen. This would not be normal play. However, South could have and should have cashed the ace and king of spades before giving West the queen of hearts. West would have to lead a club after ruffing the diamond. Even if West had a spade to play, he would likely be setting up a spade trick in dummy.",0,0,0,1

 Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s memoir,
Resolved: Uniting Nations in a Divided World
,is a candid and incisive account of his 10-year stint at the helm of the UN. His history-shaping tenure as UNSG leads us through exciting global developments and interactions with world leaders.
Ban’s memoir captures his childhood struggles caught up in the horrors of the Korean wars and poverty. He was a child of war but turned a man of peace whose belief in the UN was reinforced when it stopped the Korean War and helped rebuild institutions in his country. A chance encounter with President John F. Kennedy during a brief student exchange programme in the U.S. taught him to think beyond national boundaries and see humanity as one family.Some trade-offsIn the run-up to the UNSG elections in 2006, Ban reveals some interesting insights. Although late in the game, he used his position as Foreign Minister of his country to make trade-offs with world leaders to advance his candidature. The full backing of President Roh Moo-hyun, he admits, played a crucial role in his winning while other candidatures, including that of Shashi Tharoor, he notes, lacked strong support of their governments.An experienced diplomat when he assumed charge as UNSG, Ban believed “diplomacy is the art of the possible while negotiation is diplomacy in action.” His compassionate approach to global and regional issues is moulded by the wisdom of the ancient Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu, who taught the virtues of being like water in life to be able to adapt to situations rather than confront. Ban’s quiet diplomacy helped to rally world leaders to craft a global agenda that prioritised Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and The Paris Accord on Climate Change, two notable achievements of his tenure, to bring focus on the need for a broader agenda for human development and preservation of the planet through collective actions.His UN peace-keeping operations, driven by optimism and pragmatism, were largely successful in pacifying many disturbed parts of the world, barring West Asia and Dafur etc. On North Korea, he harboured no illusions that it wanted to enter into a deal for denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, despite the U.S.’ carrot and stick approach. In a first-ever visit by a UNSG to Iran and Myanmar, in defiance of western pressures, he engaged with the leadership there for extracting concessions for political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi who was under house arrest. He pointed at the alleged crimes against Sri Lankan Tamils in the final stages of the conflict. The controversial UN provision ‘Responsibility to Protect’ (R2P), endorsed by all nations in 2005, he observes, remained mired under suspicions of being used for regime changes in Libya, Syria, Sudan etc.Missed opportunityThe notable missed opportunity of Ban’s tenure was UN reforms, especially democratisation of the UNSC that does not reflect contemporary realities. He tamely gave up pursuing this important agenda on the feeble reasoning that the ‘veto power’ creates inevitable logjams to reform.It’s a surprise too that he didn’t acknowledge India’s contribution toUNpeace-keeping operations and human development through MDGs/SDGs commitments.And yet, in the 21st century, Ban asserts, “somewhere else” just isn’t as far away as it used to be and, therefore, global problems require global actions with a sense of collective responsibility and urgency for saving the future of our children.The reviewer is a serving Foreign Service Officer currently working in the Ministry of External Affairs.Resolved: Uniting Nations in a Divided WorldHarperCollins

For art aficionados, she’s a Blue Woman featured in dozens of French artist Yves Klein’s ‘Anthropometries’ — conceptual paintings of nudes achieved by daubing models in blue paint and having them press their bodies on paper.But Elena Palumbo-Mosca rejects being called Klein’s “living paintbrush”. She sees herself as an artistic “collaborator” who played a key part in the artist’s famous oeuvre, which today sell for fortunes.“I am not an object, but a person who shared with Yves specific ideas and who helped him to create them out of friendship and out of curiosity,” Palumbo-Mosca, who turned 87 on January 7, said.The Italian muse did not earn money from sales of the “20 or 30” works to which she contributed. She spent three decades working as an interpreter for European Union institutions in the Belgian capital.But her home is strewn with art. Her memories are too: a French Riviera stint as an au pair to a couple who were friends with Klein, then her youthful Paris student days she funded by working as a cabaret dancer.It was in February 1960 that Klein unveiled his conceptual art in his studio, using Palumbo-Mosca and other women. In March, she took part in his first public presentation, held in a Paris gallery, which critics described by using the term “living paintbrush”, which she came to resent. The invited audience, she said, was electrified by the performance during which Klein directed his paint-slicked models. “Some tore out their hair. Others applauded,” she recalled. “It was clear that we were doing something that nobody had ever done. As soon as we’d finished our work, we went to wash ourselves off-stage — the paint, after all, was toxic.”Patented paintKlein had patented the ultramarine hue of the special thick paint he developed for his paintings, calling the mix of synthetic resin, matte and pigment ‘International Klein Blue’ or IKB. The task of applying the paint was very physical, but Palumbo-Mosca was well prepared, having spent a childhood skiing and ice-skating, and having been a champion artistic diver as a teenager.Klein died in 1962 of a heart attack, just 34 years old. Today, his works — particularly ‘Anthropometries’ — can sell at auction for tens of millions of dollars.— AFP

Norwegian architecture firm Snøhetta is building a library in Beijing that might well become a reference point for future designs. The project, called Beijing Sub-Center Library, has a 16-metre-high glass façade supported by a ginkgo forest-like canopy of columns. At its heart is a huge open area, entirely visible from outside. The idea is to have an unfettered space filled with natural light for the free sharing of knowledge. Incidentally, ginkgo, among the oldest living trees, is believed to restore memory, without which there would be no literature. The tree-like columns are more than aesthetic elements — they are technical components controlling temperature, lighting, acoustic, and rainwater disposal within the building. Snøhetta, which has designed landmarks such as Oslo Opera House and the September 11 Memorial Pavilion in the U.S., is known for its extensive use of glass and mirrored metal, associated with reflection.

 Seven novels, four major accolades including the Sahitya Akademi, three nominations: Anees Salim completed a decade in Indian English Fiction in 2021. The year also marked the publication of his new novel,
The Odd Book of Baby Names,
a German translation of
Vanity Bagh
, and the announcement of his next novel,
The Bellboy
. He is now busy writing another and we caught him in the middle of a hectic schedule. Excerpts from an interview:
In strong spurts, at intervals, that’s been your publishing pattern... Shortly after
The Small-town Sea
was published, I found myself unable to write. Not that I felt empty. I had stories and characters inside me but for some inexplicable reason I could not bring myself to create or craft anything the way I wanted. It was an uncertain period for the storyteller in me.
 But slowly I regained the rhythm and started to work on an idea that had been with me for a long time and
The Odd Book of Baby Names
was born. Then I wrote
The Bellboy
. And now I am writing another one. I guess I have rediscovered the writer in me, and I feel somewhat relieved.
You have this image of a recluse. With your books reaching audiences abroad, is it time to reconsider?My interaction with the world is limited to print and social media. I use both the mediums to remind people that my books exist. I don’t believe in the concept of building an image for the author. Books can talk for the author and, in my case, other than what my books say, I don’t have much to talk about. Having said that, let me add that my views can change in the future. Sometimes I am surprised by how my outlook changes.For instance, as a boy I wanted radio stations to play sad music when I died. As an aspiring writer, I wanted my obituary to appear on the front page. Now I pine for a quiet burial. Even my neighbours should not know about my passing until a few weeks have passed. So time changes the way you look at life, and one day I might make myself less inconspicuous. But I don’t think I will do that with any pleasure.I don’t know if I should change myself because of the overseas deals. I interact with my U.K. editor every second day, and I have promised to meet her in the first half of 2022. I just hope I won’t have to do anything more than a few one-to-one meetings.How has the response been to translations of your works?My books have been translated into several Indian languages. But frankly, I don’t keep track of their performance. I have a feeling that my translated works don’t get much media attention in India. Literary magazines in regional languages are yet to take a serious look at my body of work.Can you tell us more aboutThe Bellboy?The Bellboy
is set in Kerala. It is about a 17-year-old boy from a disappearing island who ventures out to the mainland to work as a bellboy in a lodge where people usually come to die. It traces his life on the mainland and the way he loses his way in the world. The book will be published in the U.K. in September 2022 and in India in November.
How have you experimented with background and form, especially inThe Odd Book of Baby Names?I usually leave towns and cities unnamed in my books, or give them fictitious names. Real names don’t work for me, they seem to restrict the movements of my characters. I created Mangobagh (in the
The Vicks Mango Tree
) by gluing many places together. You will find a bit of Hyderabad, a bit of Lucknow, a bit of Delhi and several other cities in that. But any place with the backdrop of a beach is definitely my hometown, though I have left it unnamed in
The Blind Lady’s Descendants
and
The Small-town Sea
.
The Odd Book of Baby Names
has a different setting, and I leave it to the readers to call the city by any name they like. But I have sprinkled the story with enough clues about the setting. As to form, I was convinced that only multiple voices would work in a book which has not just two sides to the story but nine.
How do you research the backdrops for your novels?The places I have lived in help me create the backdrops. But there is more to it. When I travel, I invariably carry home the memories of some places. They may not be clean or pretty places, but they stay with me. It can be a village, a highway, an island, a beach, or just a cul-de-sac. They haunt me until I weave them into my stories. For instance,
The Small-town Sea
has a secret beach, and people who pay a visit to my hometown often ask me for directions to the secret beach. The secret beach does exist, but not in my hometown, not even in India. It is in another country and I vividly remember staying a whole day there until it was too dark to see the sea. I felt a string go taut in my chest when it was time for me to leave.
 Sometimes places stay with me not as visuals but as sounds. About three years ago, I wandered around a pine forest in Greece, and the sound of birds, not entirely pleasant, stayed in my head until I could write about it (a music that equalled the sound of 100 maracas) in
The Odd Book of Baby Names
.
Do awards matter?Awards do matter. Awards bring money to writers, but more than that, awards earn them new readers. Why an award, even inclusion in a longlist will have an immediate impact on sales. They help readers generate a reading list and inspire writers to write more.How has your writing changed in the last decade? I don’t make any conscious effort to make one book different from the other. The seed of each book comes with its own style.
The Odd Book of Baby Names
is entirely different from all the other books I have written so far. In this, I have tried to experiment with my craft a bit, and when I realised that it was getting too experimental I edited some 40 pages away.
Tell us something about your work in progress.It is about a 35-year-old man who lives with his demented mother and keeps himself engaged with a game he played in his childhood.The interviewer is a writer, editor, trainer and translator who works in Englishand Malayalam.I don’t make any conscious effort to make one book different from the other.The seed of each book comes with its own style

Writers of science fiction (SF) are living particle accelerators. In their heads, they accelerate ideas to their extremes, smash them together, and note the results. What these collisions reveal is both a snapshot of the future and the present that led to it. The second volume of
The Gollancz Book of South Asian Science Fiction
, coming after the well-received first instalment released in 2019, is therefore a detailed preview of the zeitgeist.Inher preface, Manjula Padmanabhan calls the stories “literary chimeras hatched in the nest of ancient belief systems” while the editor, Tarun H. Saint, dubs this configuration of writers and stories a New Wave of South Asian SF & Fantasy (SFF), comparable to the parallel cinema movement of the 1970s.
Adhbuta rasa So what kind of future is discerned in these three poems and 29 stories, from Sri Lankan, Indian, Pakistani, Tibetan and Bangladeshi writers? While Indians have always demonstrated a hunger for the future, usually expressed as wanting to become as ‘hi-tech’ as the West (or Shanghai or Singapore), this segues into a desire for a return to the eternal golden past. It is not a surprise then that the modern retellings of myths are equipped with
vimanas
driven by jet turbines and
brahmastras
as the ultimate WMDs.
Indeed, sociologist Shiv Visvanathan has mused, “Maybe the fecundity of our myths made the SF imagi-nation unnecessary”. But, as Saint says, the “ongoing crises” in South Asia have generated “creative and critical responses” from the SF community.Unravelling world Past crises had the same effect. Arguably the very first piece of SF by an Indian writing in English was Kylas Chunder Dutt’s
A Journal of Forty-Eight Hours of the Year 1945,
written in 1835. Two decades before the 1857 rebellion, Dutt imagined an armed rebellion against the British in 1945, proving that SF can very much be spoken as a ‘native tongue’, a play of
adhbuta rasa
. Saint’s assertion that the region’s SFF has a unique “texture and feeling” is borne out by the stories, where all the sub-genres are presented through a unique lens. For example, Jayant Narlikar’s short story ‘Yakshanchi Denagi’ is probably the politest alien invasion story ever written. Though horrific violence is implied, it is always off-screen, and the aliens are as unfailingly courteous as they are implacably evil.
 In ‘Paley’s watch’ by Anil Menon, a mysterious alien object is found, similar to the structure of the universe itself, with a “hyperbolic surface constant negative curvature”. Menon adds some
tadka
to the dal of this Out-of-Place-Artefact themed story with a youthful cross-cultural romance. Under the hyperpressure exerted by the oncoming future, language itself deforms. In Sami Ahmad Khan’s ‘Biryani Bagh’, a riff on the anti-CAA protests, you have “BiggProtestjeeviBoss subscribers”, “atom-shakti se aatm-shakti” slogans and langarbots. As the economy pivots to Big Data, the “fossil fuel of the new century”, it also becomes the
daata
(giver) of this new age.
What are the constellations revealed by this map of the future? The tone is hinted at in Vandana Singh’s ‘A Different Sea’, where the protagonist has a vision: “there was no shelter, no safety in an unravelling world.” Certain themes recur — surveillance, climate change and the uses and abuses of memory. For instance, a number of stories feature characters who are in the security services, or subject to panoptic surveillance. Two stories mention a frozen Kolkata and a freezing Dhaka. Many of the stories express the disquiet of the age, but as sci-fi writer Ted Chiang said, “Most of our anxieties about technology are best understood as fears or anxiety about how capitalism will use technology against us.” There are instances where the act of remembering is itself an act of rebellion, as a character in Navin Weeraratne’s ‘The Diamond Library’ declaims: “only in being unwritten can the truth be safe.” Then there is the contested past: in Vajra Chandrasekera’s, ‘The Maker of Memorials’, an augmented super-sculptor builds war memorials, even as conflicts rage on, all part of a grand initiative to displace “the strife of history created… with no thought as to the political needs of the future.” Still, calling this collection
pralayic
or apocalyptic would be facile. Rather, folded within the idea of dissolution is Yuganta, the end of an aeon as well as the herald of its rebirth. Perhaps we are witnessing the birth of a new sub-genre of science-fiction, a Yugantic mode, a fiction that mirrors the collapse of our world as one cycle of time unspools and another opens.
Legend has it that a terrible light is seen at the moment of the world’s dissolution — this collection harnesses that energy, like a reactor stealing from the heart of an atom. The future might not be hopeful, but the energies and innovation shown in the responses to it are.The writer is a freelance journalist and graphic novelist.The Gollancz Book of South Asian Science Fiction, Volume 2Hachette IndiaThe modern retellings of myths are equipped withvimanasdriven by jet turbines andbrahmastrasas the ultimate WMDs

 The Patnaiks are a renowned scholarly duo and emeritus professors of Jawaharlal Nehru University. More importantly, they have been keeping leftist fires aflame with their contributions over the years. Their book,
A Theory of Imperialism
, published in 2016 was provocative. It offered a framework for the emergence of imperialism and the causes for its persistence. The endeavour in that book was to “establish... continuity between the colonial period and now, notwithstanding the fact that countries of the Third World are no longer ruled by foreign powers.”
Capital & Imperialism
adopts the same or similar economic rationale or matrix but seeks to extend the scope to cover a longer historical horizon. They divide the years into five periods as narrated in Chapter 6. The first is the pre-World War I period of colonialism. The second is the interwar years. The next is the post-World War II years, the ‘Golden Age of Capitalism’. The fourth encompasses the era of globalisation. The last relates to the recent years, which also mark the dead-end of globalisation. Within this period, they narrate the march of capitalism, aided or abetted by imperialism. Though they take the view that there is an unchanging relationship between the metropolis and the periphery, they tweak the matrix, at times, to prove the continuity.
An open systemUnlike capitalist economists and even Karl Marx, the authors argue that capitalism is not a closed system. It is an open and ever-expanding system and needs a pre-capitalist periphery to support it through the supply of primary produce. Their supplies are not elastic or inexhaustible. There will be consequent price rises and inflation that can be brought down only by deflationary policies. Moreover, capitalism needs a special setting as described in Chapter 4. There are other requirements like keeping the economy open to trade, capital freedom, the pursuit of deflationary policies, etc. As they contend, “This arrangement is an integral part of ‘imperialism’, which entails the subjection of the periphery.” Though in recent years, some of the constituents governing their relationship, like dependence on primary produce, the metropolis’ reach, etc. are weakened, the authors argue, “It continues to be essential for capitalism, not just as a legacy of their past but as a requisite for the present as well.” The Patnaiks do not agree that capitalism has changed, as also its role and methods of operation or exploitation. In recent years, many leftist authors have been taking a soft view and hold that imperialism has lost its relevance. Prabhat Patnaik himself bemoaned this in an earlier article. (‘Whatever happened to imperialism?’,
Monthly Review
, November 1990.) It is discussed in this book too, as he asserts that capitalism has not changed and has to be fought by a coalition of peasants and workers. His fear is that such an ideological retreat would strengthen the rightist forces, e.g. fascism, in the global South. The authors advocate the need for vigilance and aver, “Though the content of this relationship has remained unchanged, the form of it has changed over time.” This book is an attempt to keep the debate on imperialism alive. How do they do it?
Changing global tradeThe introductory chapters posit an approach to money or wealth which is unique to capitalism. It is rigorous and scholarly. However, it fades in importance as they move on to deal with other aspects of capitalism. The setting for capitalism, as described earlier, falls back on an earlier history and seems frozen in time. There is no reckoning of the rise of the Asian tigers, of India and China, or with the changing structures of trade flows, the rise of supply chains and, lastly, the emergence of multilateral and bilateral free trade agreements. Their argument does not capture the dynamics or the complexity of current trade.The analysis of colonialism before World War I is a close study of the exploitation (drain) of India by Britain. The modality was to intercept the entire external earnings and pay the rupee equivalent to producers/exporters out of taxes raised in India. The account on ‘colonial transfers’ (Chapter 10) is meticulous and offers an estimated value up to 1947 of $1.95 trillion. More distressingly, they offer an account of the Great Famine in Bengal which was caused by “the extreme compression of mass demand to raise forced savings” to fight the war.This reviewer has misgivings over the role of imperialism in the post-war years as narrated in the book. If the Patnaiks had given up the straight jacket approach and applied the tenets of Realist and Conflict Resolution schools, they would have arrived at different perceptions about imperialism. Even the stubborn IMF/World Bank had to change their loan conditionalities under pressure from developing countries. The IMF doesn’t swear any longer by “austerity” or “fiscal deficits.” These changes have come about due to changes in power structures and the declining power of the U.S. along with growing power of the South, especially India and China. While I may differ with them on some of their arguments, it does not take away from the fact that the book is a scholarly contribution on imperialism and its long reach.The reviewer writes on economic and strategic issues.Capital & Imperialism: Theory, History and the PresentTulika Books

Translations, especially from Urdu to English, can be interesting resources in understanding how history and memory have been ‘produced’ for nation-building.Dust of the Caravan
is a translation of unfinished personal memoirs of Anis Kidwai by her granddaughter Ayesha Kidwai. It also includes extracts from previously published Partition memoirs of Anis Kidwai, also translated by Ayesha, two additional essays — character sketches of Saifuddin Kitchlew and Mridula Sarabhai — and a fictional feminist utopian piece titled ‘The Search for a Wife’.
 I first read Anis Kidwai’s
Nazr-e-Khush Guzre
, which has several delightful essays including literary criticism and character sketches of political figures.
 In its preface, Anis mentions reading an article titled “Biwi kaisi honi chahiye” (desirable qualities in a wife), by her father published in
Malumaat
magazine. In response, Anis wrote “Shauharon ki qismein” (A typology of husbands).
 Anis mentions that the magazine stopped publication in 1918 and her retort was published 13 years after the article that provoked her when
Malumaat
resumed publication in 1931.
Versatile writerFrom her translated and untranslated writings, Anis Kidwai clearly comes through as a versatile and prolific writer who possessed a keen sense of history and a sharp social critique.Women’s writing is understood as an important cultural manifestation of their agency but not too well discussed in public discourse. Overly metaphorical fiction writing by Muslim women has received more attention because of their stereotype as suppressed by Islam and Muslim men. Even within autobiographies, only 'rebellion' which fits into the prevalent western liberal feminist framing is credited with agency. Little wonder then that only those writers who have written on ‘forbidden’ or ‘taboo’ subjects have managed to remain in memory as ‘Muslim women writers’, while others slipped into oblivion. Further, owing to feminist interest in recovery of forgotten histories, autobiographical writings by Muslim women are now being translated but other non-fiction forms such as essays are still neglected.
Dust of the Caravan
thus signifies some continuity but also some breaks.
Busting mythsIn the book, Anis dispels the account that she and other Muslim women of the time could get educated only secretly. In the process she provides insights into how Muslim cultural elite women acquired knowledge, and how they and Anis carved a space for their distinctive mode of thinking within an otherwise restrictive culture. It shows that the gendered segregation of spaces in elite Muslim families was not entirely unbreached. While the early chapters echo familiar descriptions of Muslim elite households in north India, what is fascinating is Anis’s description of the everydayness of nationalist politics in her family. She records her own impressions of political events and how she eagerly followed the news. By recounting her yearning to be political and her personal struggles to join in, Anis shows that the resources for negotiating autonomy came not only from rebellion against gendered discrimination, or from anti-colonial struggle, but also from vagaries of life such as dwindling wealth and death.Time in Parliament As with all unfinished memoirs,
Dust of the Caravan
leaves the reader with a longing for what remains unwritten. I particularly imagined how valuable the account of her time in Parliament as a Rajya Sabha MP would have been.
 Reading
Dust of the Caravan
I was reminded of Qurratulain Hyder translating her own work
Aag Ka Darya
. She wrote it in Urdu in Pakistan, and translated or rather transcreated it into English as
River of Fire
after she came back to India. If we see what she omits, what she retains, and how she translates, it is like reading Qurratulain Hyder’s notion of the two nations. Through translation, Hyder was in essence interacting with readers of two distinct national communities. Anis Kidwai’s work too could be read as a text traversing the multiple nations that India has been and is becoming across space and time.

In the 1980s, when government bus service started in the somewhat interior region of Baiswara, the town near my village got better connected with the district headquarters. One fine day, an elderly man (Baba) from near my village was returning from Unnao city to his village. He was eager to board the new bus. The travelling time was reduced considerably, besides it offered comfort and convenience.When the bus arrived, Baba boarded it with delight and the journey started. When the conductor came for the ticket, he asked Baba about his destination. Baba told the name of his village. So, the conductor demanded one rupee as fare. But, Baba was an aware citizen of his time. So, he enquired what is the fare for the next stops and the previous ones. To his enlightenment, he came to know that the fare for Bhagwant Nagar (nearest town) was also the same. Bhagwant Nagar was a few kilometres from his village, after which the fares increased.Now the enlightened Baba exclaimed, “Do you think I am a fool? If one rupee is the fare for Bhagwant Nagar, why should I leave before?” The confused conductor asked, “But your village comes before Bhagwant Nagar, right?” Baba declared, “That does not matter. I will fully appropriate my fare charges and then only de-board the bus. Give me the ticket for Bhagwant Nagar.” “As you wish,” the conductor gave him the ticket for Bhagwant Nagar.When the bus arrived at Bhagwant Nagar, Baba has to finally bid adieu to his bus. But, he alighted with a sense of pride, as he was satisfied that he had fully appropriated the fare charges. After walking for a few kilometres, he reached his village and met his fellows. He was excited to tell them about the journey, and even more excited to elaborate on how he outwitted the conductor.With great pride, Baba used to tell, “The conductor tried to fool me, but I outsmarted him flat!” The story crossed the borders of his village and reached our village as well. It became a matter of discussion whether what he did was actually a smart act or not, and what others are supposed to do in such situations. People used to give their “opinions” on this matter in various gatherings. They probably did not know about the ecological footprint then. Fare and comfort were the only parameters to judge the actions of Baba!Today, it is hard to imagine what Baba would have done while travelling in the Metros, where the fare is the same for many stations. Moreover, it is not easy to come back walking! New technologies, platforms, or services always come with some humorous stories, which make embracing them more convenient. The “ice-breaking” required is done by a few legends from among us. Later on, these stories become sweet memories.emailtoaakashbajpai@gmai",0,0,0,1
"1 On January 16, 1979, a landmark nature series titled
Life on Earth
was first shown on
BBC
. In it, a presenter travels the globe in order to trace the story of the evolution of life on the planet. In his 80 years in front of the camera he is the only person to win BAFTA awards for work in Black & White, Colour, HD and 3D. Who is this iconic figure in nature conservation who has multiple species named after him?
2 Born on January 16, 1932, Dian Fossey was a conservationist who studied the mountain gorilla groups in Rwanda for 20 years. Her studies led to a better understanding of the gorilla’s intelligence. She was part of a group of women who were doing such studies under Louis Leakey. The other two were Jane Goodall, who studies chimpanzees, and Birute Galdikas, who studies Orangutans. They were known by a clever nickname which referred to the fact there were three of them and they studied this particular order of mammal (under which humans fall too). What is the nickname?3 The Axolotls are Mexican salamanders which unlike other amphibians, do not undergo metamorphosis and develop lungs and go on land. Axolotls reach adulthood without growing up, they retain their gills and remain aquatic. They also have fantastic regeneration ability, being able to rebuild jaws, spines and even brains without any scarring. This ability to ‘not grow up’ has led to the Axolotl being compared to a fictional character from a popular children’s book. Who is this child who never grew up?4 The wombat is a small marsupial found in Australia, which has an unusual way to mark their territory. When they leave to forage for food they leave distinctively shaped poop outside to let other wombats know about their burrow. Since most of the area is hilly, the distinctive shape, which looks very unnatural, ensures that it does not roll off. In what peculiar shape do wombats poop?5 All fish of this species are born with both male and female parts. In a colony that is centred around one sea anemone, the largest fish is the female and the second largest will be the male while all the others will be both. If the female were to die then the male will turn into a female and one of the smaller ones will become male. With this unique ability to change their sexes the colony ensures the safety of the community. Which fish is this whose actual life story might have changed the way a very popular children’s movie had shown?6 A herpetologist discovered a frog by accident in 2008 in Indonesia which has the ability to enlarge and inflate its nose when the male frog is calling out. This led to it being called by a particular name that references a character from a popular fairytale who had similar issues but under different circumstances. In 2019, it was finally given the same name as its species name as well. What is its name?7 The characteristic look of this animal helps break up the outline of its body, making it hard to see when it’s stalking its prey and also looks like shadows in the moonlight, disguising the presence of the animal. Interestingly not only the fur, but the skin underneath as well has the same characteristic and the pattern is unique to each individual. What animals are these whose striking feature usually brings fear to any animal in its path?8 The unique characteristic of these animals is, thanks to the presence of low-molecular weight thiol compounds and few acetate thioesters, they can be detected by a human nose at miniscule concentrations of 10 parts per billion. Which animal that has a characteristic colour pattern as well, due to this marvelous nature, has been vilified in many cartoons and movies?9 This animal’s eyes are about the size of billiard balls which give them excellent vision that is required to keep an eye out for predators in the vast plains they inhabit. Unfortunately, these eyes take up so much space in the head that the brain size is compromised and it is actually smaller than the eyeballs. Which animal is this that is known for having ‘big’ records in other departments but unfortunately not in brain size?10 This animal has the world’s slowest digestion (two weeks per meal) as they evolved to expend very little energy because the leaves they usually eat are full of toxins that these animals have evolved to digest. They have a multi-chambered stomach with a variety of bacteria that break down the leaves, but that takes a long time. Which animal is this that takes things very slowly and is the supposedly spirit animal of the presenter from Question 1?A molecular biologist from Madurai, our quizmaster enjoys trivia and music, and is working on a rock ballad called ‘Coffee is a Drink, Kaapi is an Emotion’. @bertyashley

"High up One of the vantage points in the Mahesh Khan forest reserve. Shikha Tripathi
| Photo Credit: Shikha Tripathi
The best view comes after the hardest climb, and the best forest rest houses after the toughest roads. This is the modified adage I give to my cousin at the wheel who cannot comprehend why I am always leading people on the worst roads. But there is truth in the statement, applicable to no better place than Mahesh Khan.Despite growing up in Nainital in a family of forest officers, I never visited the Mahesh Khan forest reserve until this monsoon, about 20 odd kilometres from the lake town. The last four-kilometre mark at the reserve entry takes you off smooth tarmac and delivers you onto the signature bumpy forest road that heralds the beginning of paradise. There is no one at the check post when we arrive; I hop off the car to peer into the tiny shelter where I expect a forest guard to be cocooned, but it’s empty. The dying embers of a fire, however, indicate there’s someone around definitely, and within a few moments, a man does come running out of nowhere. He checks our permit, raises the barricade with one hand and waves us through with the other, as we slip into a wonderland, preserved marvellously by the forest department.Constant rain has made little furrows in the loose soil, cutting through the narrow path with dense coniferous forest on either side. Pine dissolves into oak, and a thick bamboo undergrowth sways in the strong wind while we navigate mini streams that appear every monsoon in the hills like old-time regulars. A lone jay perched on a rock takes flight, startled by a vehicle’s intrusion after weeks of unbridled freedom. Moving ahead steadily but careful to avoid the valley on the right, we inch closer towards the forest rest house, the only place for outsiders to stay in this reserve.Architectural historyForest rest houses or FRHs are a story as worthy of conserving as the forests they are born in, for most of these buildings preserve a natural and architectural history of sorts. In a substantially impaired bureaucratic system, here is one that has endured. Not much has changed about these basic structures that were originally built for forest officers to stay in while they inspected forests, or the way they are run for that matter. In a world of privatisation, these are relics from a forgotten era. So when we arrive at the rather premium log huts, I’m surprised; forest rest houses are not supposed to be this flattering. It’s then that I learn from the caretaker Ramesh that this is a new addition built in recent years, and that the original bungalow is a short hike up. Before Ramesh can finish orienting us with the place, Jackson and Roman have shown up, their wagging a mix of curiosity and caution. The duo guard the place, says Ramesh, but can be easily bought with a snack. Hope you’ve got your dinner, he asks, in keeping with the protocol of FRHs where meals are not available. I nod a yes, and we are shown into the unexpected luxury of our bamboo cottages, complete with wooden furniture and a private porch. A lone bulb lights the room rather poorly, but when at a forest rest house, who is there to spend time indoors anyway? The porch becomes our haven and the evening is spent cradled in its shelter. I sink into wordless awe of the silent forest that sits draped in a translucent cloak of mist like a solemn princess. Come morning, I shall set out into this mystical blur to find out more. Little is known about the Mahesh Khan forest reserve, including why it has an intriguing name. An uphill trail leads to the original bungalow, and I follow closely in Jackson’s muddy paws. Searing through the forest as sunbeams break through the screen of fog particles, we emerge into a clearing at the top. Standing tall is the original dak bungalow built over a hundred years ago in 1911. I meet no one on the premises just as on the trail, and can hear the echo of my whistle across the open foyer. A small metal plaque commemorates the inaugural of the atmospheric building, which is in a pretty decent condition. A short walk further up is Tagore Top, supposedly visited by Rabindranath Tagore when he was writing the
Gitanjali
. I’ve come across multiple Tagore points in the hills that the legendary poet is believed to have traversed a century ago, and perhaps this too was another spot.
Perfect solitudeA sharp bark snaps me out, but it can’t be Jackson; he has long retreated. A repeat in short, regular intervals confirms it’s the alarm call of a barking deer, prey for the leopards this forest is home to. It’s time to walk back, but not without a detour and pit-stop at a little machan I discovered on the previous evening’s saunter. I tread lightly on the rickety wooden stairs that creak under my moderate weight, and take in the half-visible valley, the velvety silence, and the spruce trees springing out of the claggy, Dickensian setting. Somewhere I am at peace, relieved that should I return to this setting someday, I shall find everything as is. I am assured it will remain protected, and hopeful I’ll unearth the story behind a forest called Mahesh Khan.Born and brought up in the Himalayas, the writer is an adventurer who derives great joy from napping under the mountain sun.

We were meeting after a gap of 50 years, the alumni of a Bengaluru co-ed school. The excitement was palpable. It had all started off when four enthusiastic classmates of the batch of 1972 formed a WhatsApp group called “School Mates” and gradually decided to grow it. We did not even know what messages to post. Back in the 1970s, we boys and girls had been too timid to have much to do with each other, forget interacting the way today’s generation does.At the beginning, getting our school mates together was a very arduous task. It was difficult to locate them after such a long span of time, but gradually the group grew, very slowly at first then faster and faster to over 20 members.Gradually, the posts stirred a desire to have a Zoom meeting. Two or three virtual meetings later, everybody felt it necessary to meet in person, most of us being naturally curious about how the ravages of time had affected one another.But how was this possible? Over the years, we spread over to Canada, the U.S. and several other cities in India. Some of us had retired after working abroad and had now settled down in India. In fact, our most enthusiastic member, hell-bent on immediately organising a reunion, was in Delhi.The Bengaluru- based alumni finally got together one bright Sunday morning with nine classmates meeting at a prominent mid-town club. Of course, there were hiccups, as two of us had last-minute chores to attend, while another had a bereavement, but we were together at last. But what was there to talk about? Fifty years ago, the boys had been too shy to speak to the girls and vice versa. So how to break the ice (most being grandparents now)?One person began to simulate a board meeting, reading out agenda items one after the other, finding out how we could assist our school. This was promptly vetoed out as it was essential to get to know each other first before starting any activity! Yet another put in a video call to our most enthusiastic member in Delhi to ask what next. Everyone remembered a very attractive biology teacher and how several boys would go and attend her class despite being mathematics students. Another remembered how he had hit a classmate in the eye accidentally while playing hockey. Several others recalled how we had been together at NCC camps. Punishments which had seemed highly embarrassing then now brought smiles to our faces. Discussing our old school lives, specially the fun moments when everything seemed much better despite the homework and teacher’s punishment, took up a large part of our meeting time.Nothing beats a school alumni group of friends from a time when we are incapable of selfishness. As social beings, we crave for opportunities to exchange our collective memories, ideas, views, experiences, opinions and agendas and an alumni meet is just the occasion to get together with old friends whom we have not met for years.priyannaik211@gmail.com

"oday’s deal is from an all-expert team match. Both East-West pairs bid to the cold six hearts and both North-South pairs judged well to sacrifice in six spades.Six spades doubled has three obvious losers and the best East-West can do on this deal is to put 500 points in the bank. Accidents, however, can happen on the way to the bank.North was “walking the dog” in the auction, trying to buy the contract at the lowest level possible. It almost worked, but West saved the day for East-West when he came alive and bid six hearts. North bid what he was always prepared to bid and West wound up on lead.West knew that a heart lead was pointless and he was hoping to hold the lead after the first trick in case there was some obvious shift once he saw the dummy.He made the “expert” lead of the king of diamonds! He was unable to hold the lead. East overtook the king with the ace perforce. East was reluctant to cash his ace of clubs as that might give away an important trick. There was no immediate danger in the diamond suit, as he “knew” that his partner held the queen.

Dear Agony Akka,I am a young woman in my 30s and I have a high-profile career in the software industry. I work for very long hours and sometimes I even don’t get any off days. On top of that, I work from home and this means that my mother, father and brother keep coming into my room to disturb me. Furthermore, each morning and night, before and after office hours, my mother talks about my marriage. My work pressure is fine but these other pressures from family I am finding very hard to manage. I think I will go crazy. Please can you suggest some therapy or cure. —
Miserable and depressedDear MAD,One cannot help feeling miserable and depressed these days when it keeps raining like how it has been raining in Chennai. It has been non-stop floods and drizzles and showers and what not and what with the clothes not drying and the walls getting fungus, I am also finding it very hard to manage. Of course, nobody is forcing me to get married but whether one is forced into matrimony or whether one is forced to find new, new spots to dry wet clothes in the house, the effect of the pressure upon the brain is the same.But unlike you I have found the perfect remedy for all mental strain. I have invested in a mosquito bat. As you must be aware when it rains in Chennai there is also a veritable storm of mosquitoes. They invade your house and buzz in your ears like the anchors of TV news channels. And they cannot be switched off either.But offence is the best form of defence. So now each morning I pick up the mosquito bat and I go from room to room chasing them instead of vice versa. I hunt behind doors and under beds. I shake sheets and I move chairs. They slowly emerge from their hiding spots like how sun rays are now emerging in Chennai. Then I swat them. There is one sharp cracking sound, then sizzling sound, then smell of dead mosquito. It is the most satisfying feeling in the world. It is better than a dozen therapy sessions with your favourite shrink or one hour of yoga in the morning.Sometimes they fall on the floor without any sound. I carefully find them and swat them again to hear the buzz. Ah the extraordinary gratification. It makes me forget all my problems. And a bat costs only Rs. 200-300, much cheaper than counselling.I regret that scientists are not doing enough to invent a similar bat for use against annoying human beings. Naturally, I don’t wish for humans to sizzle and die like mosquitoes — I am a pacifist — but something equivalent that could temporarily shut up the aunties who nag single women to get married can be a rather useful addition to science. My only request is to retain the sizzling sound. It is a key component for the therapy to work.Meanwhile, before another full lockdown begins, I strongly recommend that you find a café nearby with Internet facility and start working from there. Families are very nice and loving and they cook food and all that but spending all your time cooped up with them in a flat is like being quarantined with Goonjana Vilom Kashyap. Loud, pointless, and irritating.— AAagony.akka@gmail.co",0,0,0,1

Pullela Gopichand’s victory at the 2001 All England Open Badminton Championships was a landmark moment in Indian sport. The fairytale run, with victories over established stars, saw Gopichand emerge as only the second Indian to achieve this feat after Prakash Padukone. It is fitting that his autobiography,
Shuttler's Flick: Making Every Match Count
, written with Priya Kumar, opens with a description of this triumph. Going into the final against World No.3 Chen Hong, Gopichand was physically exhausted. A big dose of mental fortitude and game acumen was needed to overcome his fancied opponent.
The journeyGopichand’s journey began with the immense sacrifices made by his family. His parents, Subash Chandra and Subbaravamma, devoted their finances, love and attention to shaping his career. There are several references to his modest upbringing. Gopichand avoided smashes during practice to extend the life of precious shuttles, and was forced to borrow racquets from other players when strings snapped during a match.Gopichand is honest about the “over-age” problem that ails Indian sport. He describes how he would turn up at junior national tournaments, only to face a bearded adult on the other side of the court. It took a reassuring touch from his mother to soothe the pains of an unfair loss.Can there be a success story without self-belief? Gopichand had this quality in abundance. It came to the fore when he declared to his defeatist Indian teammates on a tour to Malaysia that he had it in him to beat the best in the world. Those were fighting words, given that Gopichand was the youngest in the group, and yet to make a mark on the international stage. It would take a few more years for Gopichand, who describes himself as “confident, arrogant and self-assured”, to make good on his daring claim.The book devotes plenty of space to the hard work it took to build the Gopichand Badminton Academy, which has counted Saina Nehwal, P.V. Sindhu, Srikanth Kidambi, Parupalli Kashyap and many others as wards.Gopichand had to run from pillar to post to gather the funds required to build the grand project, which finally came to fruition thanks to donations from generous benefactors.Candid shotsUnlike many other star names, Gopichand does not shy away from tackling prickly subjects. He speaks candidly about shifting out from the Prakash Padukone Badminton Academy (PPBA) as a young player, as he was overwhelmed by the towering presence of the legendary Padukone.The matter of Saina exiting his own academy in 2014 — reportedly caused by Gopichand devoting his energy to Sindhu — is handled tactfully. The rationale given is that Gopichand just did not have the time to give each player the individual attention they desired.Author Priya Kumar, a motivational speaker, at times veers away from the script, but for the most part, Gopichand’s story remains in focus.Frequent inputs from Gopichand’s wife P.V.V. Lakshmi, his parents, Saina, Sindhu and others come as a welcome addition to this cerebral, inspiring read.Shuttler’s Flick: Making Every Match CountSimon & Schuster India

The tree is now officially calledUvariopsis dicaprio. About 4 metres tall,U. dicapriohas lustrous yellow-green flowers growing on its trunk that make it immediately recognisable. The ylang-ylang tree native to India and Southeast Asia is a close cousin. At present, less than 50 individual trees have been spotted in Ebo, makingU. dicapriocritically endangered. New species are often named after celebrities: there is the Hugh Hefner rabbit (Sylvilagus palustris hefneri), Prince Charles frog (Hyloscirtus princecharlesi), and a beetle named after DiCaprio’s co-actor fromTitanic, Kate Winslet (Agra katewinsletae). DiCaprio has been closely associated with the star-studded campaign to stop logging in Ebo Forest, a green paradise in rapidly urbanising Africa that is home to endangered gorillas, monkeys and chimpanzees. The Banen people living there depend on the forest for food and medicine and consider it their ancestral land. Ebo Forest was officially proposed as a protected national park by the Cameroon government in 2006. However, in February 2020, the government proposed a licensing that would have resulted in logging concessions. The president of Cameroon cancelled these proposals in August 2020, to great jubilation by activists.

Also, the first time the lavish American film and TV awards show, a precursor-of-sorts to the Oscars, was not televised, had no audience or red carpet celebrities, and was completely boycotted by the industry. The winners were announced via the social media handles of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the non-profit behind the awards that has long faced allegations of financial irregularities and lack of diversity. After anLA Timesexposé last year brought the corruption and absolute lack of black representation to the fore, many Hollywood A-listers joined the protests that had previously rocked the Oscars too. Tom Cruise famously returned his three Globes, and Netflix and various movie studios vowed to discontinue promotional activities. NBC, the Globes’ long-time broadcaster, said it wouldn’t air the awards ceremony in 2022 and called for “meaningful reform”. A few months later, the group announced more reforms, brought on a black chief diversity officer, and added 21 new members, including six black journalists.

When Joe Davis, who works at Rutland Water Nature Reserve, was landcaping the reserve, he noticed something unusual sticking out from the earth. He thought it was a dinosaur fossil, but it turned out to be the bones of an ichthyosaur. The ichthyosaur, a warm-blooded marine reptile, could grow up to 25 metres long and lived over 180 million years ago. This specimen, which is more than 10 metres long, is the largest and most complete ever found in the U.K. According to Dean Lomax, a palaeontologist who specialises in ichthyosaurs, Britain is “the birthplace of ichthyosaurs” whose fossils have been unearthed here for over 200 years.

 I recently read in an American journal that Goethe’s
Faust
was produced as a three-dimensional drama, meaning that it was a three-in-one literary, musical and dance theatre staged in an off-Broadway open-air theatre festival. This provoked me to think about
Silappadikaram
, one of the five Tamil epics known as
Panja Kaviyangal,
written by non-Vedic poets. I am not sure whether there is any work dating from the early centuries of the common era in any other regional Indian language that has so much in common with Sanskrit with regard to the theory and practice of musical and theatrical forms.
Silappadikaram
is written by Ilango Adigal, a Jain monk. Storywise, it is strikingly original, not outsourced from Sanskrit, but the classical dance and theatrical forms it makes use of have close affinity with the regulations stipulated in the Sanskrit theatre manual,
Natya Shastra
, attributed to Bharata Muni.
Master of arts We know very little about our ancient authors, though myths about them are plenty. It might be an interesting speculation to think of Ilango and Bharata as one and the same person, who not only wrote a manual but also illustrated it through fiction in the form of
Silappadikaram
.
According to Heinrich Zimmer (1890-1943), Sanskrit being the common language of communication among the intellectuals of India in those days, many of the metaphysical and theoretical works in Sanskrit might have had South Indian authorship. However, it is difficult to date our authors and works according to Western ideas of time as our concept of history is cyclical, not linear. Is
Silappadikaram
a play or an epic? It is both. It is this distinction that makes it different from literary works in any Indian language, including Sanskrit. Ilango, the consummate dramatist and innovative literary master that he is, initiates a new genre called
Muththamizh viraviya pattudai ceyyul,
a cultural form integrating poetry, music and drama. Like Shakespeare, he knows that each word has two values, dramatic and literary. Only in the hands of a genius, words acquire their appropriate literary or dramatic identity depending on the context — whether you read it as a poem or see it as a play in your mind’s eye. In other words, a ‘literary word’ acquires a new incarnation as ‘dramatic word’ when it is performed as a play on stage and one can visually experience it.
Anklet as metaphorShakespeare is lucky as he had good directors and actors to project him on stage as an unparalleled playwright and also a large number of literary critics to establish his credentials as a poet extraordinaire. Ilango is unfortunate in this regard since there has been no analytical, in-depth study of his work as a one-of-its-kind epic drama. Even the dance dramas attempted so far, supposedly based on this work, have not done justice to its vigour and multi-faceted brilliance.Silappadikaram 
means ‘The Story of the Anklet’,
silambu
being the anklet worn by young, unmarried Tamil girls in ancient times that was removed on their wedding day. So
silambu
is a metaphor for virginity and innocence, which later became the insignia of the
pathni
cult (the worship of chastity).
Like Greek tragedy The anklet of the title belongs to the protagonist, Kannagi. It proves to be the agent of destiny for her; the hero, Kovalan (Kannagi’s husband); and the Pandya king who unjustly has Kovalan killed for a crime he has not committed, then himself dies on realising his blunder. The wrath of Kannagi burns down the capital city of the Pandyas. Later, the Chera king invades the North and pelts rocks on the heads of the defeated North Indian kings for installing an icon and building a temple to Kannagi. The anklet proves pivotal in all of this: any stage production of
Silappadikaram
should have a surrealistically huge image of the anklet as its backdrop. It represents Destiny.
 Like Fate in Greek tragedies, Destiny plays a significant role in
Silappadikaram
. As Ilango says, it announces itself in the
yaazh
(harp) that Kovalan plays, leading to his separation from Madhavi the courtesan and his subsequent death in Madurai, the Pandyan capital. Again, it is Destiny that visits the tongue of the Pandya king who, instead of saying ‘Bring the culprit, inquire, and if he is the one who stole the queen’s anklet, then kill him,’ blabbers without thinking, ‘Kill him if he has the anklet and bring it to me’.
 Matalan, a Brahmin and a friend of Kovalan, functions like the chorus in Greek tragedy. He appears in two cantos, the
Madurai Kantam
and
Vanchi Kantam,
and provides the link to all the events that happen offstage. In
Adaikalakathai
(chapter on refuge), we come to know of all the noble qualities possessed by Kovalan, courtesy Matalan. The dramatic value of this scene lies in building up the audience’s admiration for the hero so that the shock is greater when he is wrongfully killed in the very next scene.
To enhance the tragic intensity, Ilango brings Kovalan and Kannagi together in the last scene before Kovalan’s death, when Kannagi serves him the delicious food she has cooked for him. They seem to be enjoying the blessings of a happy married life after a long gap, but Destiny has the last laugh. The lunch proves to be Kovalan’s last supper. As in Shakespeare’s plays, after an emotionally charged scene, there is dramatic relief in the form of comedy. A pastoral dance (
Aychiyar Kuravai
) performed by cowherd girls to ward off evil succeeds the death scene.
Different classical and folk forms of music and theatre found in three regions of South India (Chola, Pandya and Chera) are beautifully documented in this three-dimensional epic, which stills awaits staging by a competent theatre director.The writer, also known as Ee. Paa, is a veteran Tamil littérateur and cultural historian.It might be an interesting speculation to think of Ilango and Bharata as one and the same person, who not only wrote a manual but also illustrated it through fiction in the form ofSilappadi",0,0,0,1

The objectives of the study on ‘How Modi’s hybrid regime model [is] reshaping political narratives, ecosystems and national symbols’ are ambitious. The projects of the ruling party are certainly ambitious. It wishes to spatially and ideologically remake the country by reconstructing Lutyen’s Delhi, by building a temple where once a grand mosque stood, by introducing a political language that cares two hoots for propriety, and by superciliously dismissing the contributions of Jawaharlal Nehru to democracy.Has it succeeded? Perhaps yes. Barely 10 years ago scholars were writing on multiculturalism, secularism, and minority rights. Today we are back to where modern political theory began — the right to life and liberty in times of mob lynching and police atrocities. How did the political mood turn around so quickly? P. Raman in this detailed exposition of one man’s rise to absolute power answers the question very well.Standing up to the RSSThe story begins on February 19, 2013, when Mohan Bhagwat assured the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) hierarchy’s full support to Modi as the prime ministerial candidate. Very soon Modi defied the fundamental presupposition of the organisation; that the individual, no matter how powerful he may be, is subordinate to the collective. He informed senior leaders that he would always be there whenever they called. There was no need to set up a coordination committee to regulate the relationship between a future government and the RSS. In any case his Mission-272, that of securing a majority in Parliament, was intended to reduce dependence on secular allies. He would institutionalise Hindutva so dear to the heart of RSS leaders. They need not worry.Some leaders were nevertheless wary of him. His commitment to liberalisation and to the corporatisation of the economy went against Swadeshi so ardently defended by the organisation. But he was backed enthusiastically by RSS supremo Bhagwat. He was also openly supported by top corporate leaders of initially Gujarat, and then from the rest of the country. The scene was set for “the rise of a classical kind of authoritarian political boss... Like the elected dictators the world over, he communicated directly to voters and party ranks.” Modi’s political strategy was a ‘deadly mix of hard Hindutva and unadulterated neoliberal framework’.Economic liberalisation was conjoined to political illiberalism. The former was secured by corporates. They placed their enormous funds, their media houses, PR agents, digital engineers and survey agencies at the feet of an incoming Modi regime. Political illiberalism was secured by Hindutva that relentlessly subordinates individual citizens to the nation conceived of in purely majoritarian terms.Around the twin planks of his ideology gathered WhatsApp administrators, lynch mobs coordinators, those who rallied audiences, cash dispensers and alcohol distributors. Modi rallies have rewritten the grammar of how elections are fought. His image was projected on gigantic screens, and cheer leaders outshouted other BJP leaders. He was presented as India’s new messiah, the conquering hero who would vanquish the old elite.No visibility and voiceThe BJP came to power in 2014 and we witnessed the quick degeneration of parliamentary democracy into autocratic populism. Under the Modi regime, elected ministers have been reduced to nothing. They have little visibility and even less voice. The PM chastises them as if they are schoolboys. They are not invited to meetings he holds with their bureaucrats. Civil servants are responsible directly to him. All decisions of ministries have to be cleared by the Prime Minister’s Office. RSS leaders monitored the government for the first two years. With the appointment of Amit Shah as the party president, the rules changed. The RSS was pushed to the margins.Centralised rule seldom makes for good governance though. Badly conceptualised policies of demonetisation and GST led to chaos and intensified poverty. Schemes announced with much fanfare lapsed, and the enthusiasm of the leadership waned.As power came to be centralised in the office of the prime minister, organisations meant to share power or check it, from the RBI to the CBI were hijacked. Yet the Modi juggernaut continued to roll. The BJP secured even more seats in the 2019 general election. This encouraged the government to unfurl the full agenda of Hindutva from Kashmir to Ayodhya and beyond.Demise of institutionsIn the last chapter, Raman surveys the literature on authoritarian populism and concludes that the concept is appropriate for India. The country has seen the personalisation of power and the demise of institutions ranging from Parliament to civil society. Enthusiastically acclaimed by a media that forgets that it is a part of civil society which keeps watch on the exercise of power, and not a PR arm of the government, Modi has succeeded in making people forget the tragedies his misconceived policies have heaped on India. We are left to ponder an unpalatable question. Have Indians become apolitical, more attracted to strong leaders rather than democratic ones?The reviewer is Distinguished Fellow, Centre for Equity Studies.Tryst with Strong Leader PopulismAakar Publications

 In 2020, as COVID-19 became a global experience, writers from around the world responded to it, trying to make sense of a 21st century pandemic and its aftermath. Edited by Ilan Stavans,
And We Came Outside and Saw the Stars Again
highlighted the fact that a rampaging virus had brought about “the collapse of a hierarchy of principles” the world had embraced till then. Though as Stavans pointed out in the introduction, the misfortune arrived when the essential tenets of globalisation were already being questioned, with “tariffs imposed, borders closed, immigrants seen with suspicion.” While some writers saw it as a time to recalibrate and start afresh, others argued that paranoid dystopias (of Franz Kafka, Aldous Huxley, George Orwell and Yevgeny Zamyatin) had become the “gross and brutal reality” of our time.
Reconfiguring boundaries All of 2021 passed in a haze of lockdowns, new deadlier variants, the race for vaccines, hospitalisations and deaths, and the new year dawned with another highly contagious, slightly milder variant on the prowl, leading to case surges around the world.
The COVID Spectrum
is an anthology of essays from several countries on a disease that has plunged countries into an unprecedented crisis. In their introduction, the editors, Kanchana Mahadevan, Satishchandra Kumar, Meher Bhoot and Rajesh Kharat, all from the University of Mumbai, write that the essays “examine the possibilities of reconfiguring boundaries imposed by symptoms such as the ‘infodemic’ and forced separation.” Some of the ‘neo-normals’ that remain include quarantine, virtual worlds, surveillance, fragile health systems, while questions have been raised about “inequality, authoritarianism, welfare, trauma and sustainability.”
In his foreword, the Slovenian philosopher, Slavoj Zizek, contends that today more than ever, egalitarianism is not just a vague ideal but an urgent necessity — vaccines for all, universal healthcare, global struggle against the global warming. He cites the example of Ugur Sahin, BioTech’s CEO, a Turk living in Germany whose company invented one of the early COVID-19 vaccines. In an interview at the end of 2020, Sahin said, “At the moment, it doesn’t look good — a hole is appearing because there’s a lack of other approved vaccines and we have to fill the gap with our own vaccine.” Zizek says this was a “wonderful moment when the CEO of a company wanted his competitors to get stronger because he knows that only together can we win the struggle against the pandemic.”Theory and experienceThe first part, ‘Theorising the Pandemic’, has articles on diverse issues around COVID-19, from adapting to the virus, conspiracy theories, fake news, the fundamentals of care. In her essay, ‘The Limits of Responsible Caring in the COVID-19 Pandemic’, Joan Tronto, writing from America, says given how unpredictably the virus affected people, humans could not deny their mortality and the sense of vulnerability this knowledge produced. Yet, she adds, that from this vulnerability came another revelation, i.e., “the profound awareness of the fact that not all people were equally vulnerable. Some are at much greater risk.”Narratives from Cuba (Vinay Lal), Hong Kong (Ada Kot), Mauritius (Basantsingh Deerpaul), Kathmandu (Raji Manjari Pokhrel and Prathama Raghavan) comprise the second part, together with reflections on lessons from COVID-19, how to keep young children safe and dealing with the aftermath. In his essay, ‘The Great Reset?’, Zizek quotes the German philosopher Jurgen Habermas observing in April 2020 that “there never was so much knowing about our not-knowing and about the constraint to act and live in uncertainty.” Zizek points out that Habermas is right when he says that this “not-knowing” does not concern only the pandemic, but even more its economic, social and psychic consequences. Will the post-Corona universe be just another future or something new ‘to come’? According to Zizek, in the midst of “existential uncertainties” we have to change our economic life so that it will be able to survive lockdowns and emergencies that await us. “We need to do what is impossible.”The COVID SpectrumSpeaking Tiger

1 On January 23, 1957, American inventor Walter Frederick Morrison sold the rights to his invention, which he called the ‘Whirlo-Way’ to the Wham-O toy company. He had come up with the idea in 1937 when he and his girlfriend were throwing a popcorn lid and a cake pan around. Wham-O decided to sell the product as 'Pluto Platter' but college students had come up with another name for it, based on a bakery whose pie tins served the same purpose. How better do we know this toy that even has a sport based on it?2 Shirley and Eddie Clarkson designed the first Paddington Bear toy in 1972 and gave it to their 11-year-old son. The well-made toys received several compliments, so they began selling the bears in local stores. Paddington Bear creator Michael Bond wanted to sue them both for copyright infringement, but on encountering them in a lift and realising how sweet they were, gave them the license. This allowed them both to earn well and send their son to a good school. Who was the son who now has multiple shows on OTT on history, wars, guns, farming and cars, and owes his life to this toy?3 This toy is a simple remote control-like device that has a button and a photodiode. When you press it, it causes the TV screen to completely black for one frame. The diode samples the colour reading as a reference and in the next frame causes only the target area to become white. If the game the toy is connected to detects the shift from black to white, you get points. What is the most famous game that used this toy and involved a giggling dog?4 This American company was established as an institute in 1928 by Lucille King. She developed wooden toys to use as teaching aids for children in the classroom. Since 1984 it has been owned by Hasbro but still produces many lines of educational toys. What company is this whose name was literally what they used to do?5 One of the most popular toys the world over is a puzzle game created by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984. Its popularity led to an actual psychological effect named after it. The effect is a creative urge to fit shapes together, to organise, to build, to make deals, to fix, to fold sheets. What is the name of this effect?6 The largest toy company in the world started in 1932, in a workshop in Denmark, when Ole Kirk Christiansen began making wooden toys. He named the company after the Danish phrase that means ‘play well’. As of 2021 the company is valued at $6.5 billion and more than 700 billion pieces of their iconic bricks have been made. What company is this, which also has movies, games and even amusement parks?7 Matchbox was a popular toy brand which got its name because its toys were sold in boxes similar to actual matchboxes. Their biggest hits were small-scale models of production cars. Elliot Handler and his wife saw their son playing with one of these and came up with an idea. They would produce customised/ modified ‘hot rod’ versions of these cars, eg. with bigger tyres, hood blowers, flame stickers etc. It became a huge hit and was bought over by Mattel, eventually taking over Matchbox as well. By what name do we know this company?8 Frank Hornby was an English inventor who, though having no formal training in engineering, was responsible for the invention and production of three of the most popular lines of toys based on engineering principles. Two of them are Dinky Toys that made die-cast scale model vehicles, and Hornby Railways, which make model train sets. The third is a brand of model construction system, which contains reusable metal strips, plates, wheels, axles and gears, nuts and bolts. This enables kids to build working models and mechanical devices. What is the name of this company, which till date is a popular birthday gift for young kids?9 A ‘Gyroscopic Effect’ is the ability of a rotating body to maintain a steady direction of its axis of rotation. This combines the universal laws of inertia (and momentum), friction and gravity, and the transfer of potential to kinetic energy. What toy, which has been around for thousands of years (earliest reference is from 3500 BC), works purely on this principle?10 These dolls, which received a GI tag in 2009, have a history dating back to King Saboji’s kingdom. Known for their detailed, painted exteriors and famous bobble-head, and made from materials such as papier mache, plaster of Paris, or very light wood, these dolls have a very low centre of gravity that allows them to have a continuous dance-like movement. Named after the city the GI tag attributes it to, what is the name of these dolls?A molecular biologist from Madurai, our quizmaster enjoys trivia and music, and is working on a rock ballad called ‘Coffee is a Drink, Kaapi is an Emotion’. @bertyashley

Whoever thought conversation could be bottled, packaged like perfume and sold to those who want to capture a sense, a feeling, an idea. Rewind. Start over. Whoever thought a conversation could be boxed, and when opened, could lead one into new worlds of knowledge and imagination. Whoever thought conversation could become a commodity?The podcasting business thrives on conversation — short takes, mid-sized, and long, unfurling like the mythical tail of Hanuman. These must be distinguished from interviews, which have a discrete and specific purpose, with a clear boundary between seeker and giver of information and insight. Journalistic interviews may serve the purposes of extracting or confirming the news of the day, or as a platform for portraiture, where we watch, listen or read someone drawing out personality. But the conversational podcast does something different; it invites the listener into a closed room to hear the wheels of two minds as they turn.The best conversational podcasts are those where there the host and the guest meet on a level platform — not so much in terms of domain expertise, but as two (or more) people who share a curiosity that is jointly explored as they speak. There is a genuine sense of listening to questions and carefully crafted answers that in turn generate more questions, both for those within the conversation and those listening to it. Even as the exchange is being recorded, the participants do not seem performing. They are so deeply involved in the interchange that the sense of an audience is completely absent.There are any number of such podcasts, each of which gains its flavour from the style of the host and the scope that they set out.All women One that I discovered a few weeks ago was
The Indian Edit
, hosted by Nitasha Manchanda, that features conversations with “innovators in design, culture and entrepreneurship”. Manchanda’s guests are all women with a connection, as she says, to the Indian subcontinent. These are not women you would have encountered unless you have a special interest in the fields they represent — perfumery, craft design, children’s publishing, community media, cuisine, among others — but each has a story to tell and a perspective to share. Manchanda notes on her website that as a podcast listener, she rarely came across shows about the kind of people she wanted to hear from, or hear about. In the three years or so that the show has run, she has sampled a wide range of creators and risk-takers, each of whom introduces you to the window of opportunity that they pushed open for themselves. Some conversations do move into the rarefied reaches of high-end fashion and haute cuisine, but overall, there’s something there for those who find themselves stuck, at any stage in life.
Go with the flowYou can sample the episodes in any order, but one I would recommend features Sarah Thomas, founder of Kalamata’s Kitchen, an enterprise that aims to make adventurous and compassionate eaters of children, as also the episode where guest Aarti Jaiman of community radio Gurgaon ki Awaaz details her journey.The conversational podcast is perhaps the simplest kind to record and package; it calls for fairly basic production and sound design skills. But it is not easy to sustain, and those who have managed to run a show for any length of time deserve appreciation. And, like Manchanda, if they’ve managed to package it with character, even more so.

 In the introduction to his fourth novel,
Kanganam
, Perumal Murugan talks about the word
kanganam
and what it means. It refers to the ritual yellow thread that people undertaking an important event, such as wedding or temple feast, wear around their wrist. Especially significant for a groom, the
kanganam
signifies that from that moment on, its wearer will bring all their focus and energies only to the task on hand and not leave the wedding hall or take on other responsibilities. Over time, the word came to mean an absolute determination to finish a task, a single-minded focus.
 But the English word, ‘resolve’, while containing multiple meanings in itself, becomes in the translation only a person’s determination to finish a task. Gone are the layers — the idea of weddings and rituals, the carefully concealed social commentary on changing mores. Marking time from when the
kanganam
was a reminder to focus, to stay true to the event, the house, the relationship, to when the
kanganam
merely became an ornament, a phrase.
Little touchesThat loss in translation in the title is carried through the entire book. This is not to say that the translation is bad or inadequate. In fact, Aniruddhan Vasudevan carries the tone and import of the Tamil novel faithfully to the English version. The story’s slow build-up, the layering of events, the people, the settings, and the little touches of rural Tamil Nadu of the 80s and 90s — they’re all there.Resolveis the story of Marimuthu, a farmer in his 30s. Marimuthu yearns to be married, to feel the touch of another human next to him, to have someone to hold on to. He has felt this need from when he turned 18. However, circumstances and the actions of people around him have denied him marriage. We come to Marimuthu via Kuppan, an agricultural labourer bonded to Marimuthu’s family, whose entire life has been spent in service to the family. Through Kuppan and Marimuthu, we see and hear Marimuthu’s family, Paati, Ammayi, each carrying generations of resentment, grudges and anguish, and occasionally voicing them. In particular, Paati (Pooavatha) and Ammayi (Virumaka) are two old women who have lived through changing times, served the men they married and the patriarchy they were wedded to, but still managed to hold on to will and agency.Toll of expectationsThen there’s Thanavadhi Thatha, a go-between for anything from marriages to land deals to brokering peace between clans. Given Marimuthu’s one preoccupation, there are many marriage brokers, including the sharp-tongued Veeduthi and the retired maths teacher. There’s Selvarasu, Marimuthu’s estranged cousin, a man who knows what he wants and how to get it, and who is prepared to let old grudges go. There’s also Raman, Marimuthu’s friend, confidante and co-conspirator.Then there are the women — Rosamani, Vasanthi, Poovalayi and more, who could have been Marimuthu’s wives if things had gone well, but end up instead as the objects of his dreams and nightmares. These are minor characters, but each with a full life behind them.Underpinning this are the twin systems of caste and patriarchy. Murugan explains a bit in his introduction, but it comes through in greater detail in the story. The desire for sons that has created an unequal male-female ratio. The pressure to be a conforming, fecund member of society. The toll it takes on women and men.On caste, Murugan presents his commentary with no fanfare but it still hits you with force. It explains Kuppan’s ties to the family: Kuppan recalls, at the very beginning, that the coconut palms in Marimuthu’s farms were planted when he, Kuppan, was but a boy and had just begun working for the family. In all likelihood, Kuppan will die in bondage to the family. There’s the subtle difference in how Marimuthu and Raman — seen as friends — are treated by the village. Despite his promises to Raman, Marimuthu has no qualms turning over land to his cousin, keeping property within the family. Through the book, caste along with its hold on people is presented as is, with no heavy-handed commentary — which makes it all the more powerful as you realise how ingrained it is.Final flavourTranslations are always tricky. Especially between two languages that are as idiomatic, with regional quirks and dialects, as Tamil and English. The translator has to weigh the needs of the story, the style and form in which it is presented, the limits of the source language, the capacity of the target language.Perhaps at those points, the story and its overall arc will weigh more than the styling or the flavour. While I understood the compromise in
Resolve
, I could not help feeling sad. A bit like the death of a public figure you admire; it’s not a direct personal loss, but it still hurts you. Would it have helped if one simply rewrote the entire thing in English, less of a translation and more of a retelling?
 There is this term
terroir
, which describes the character a crop acquires from its environment. The soil, water, air, they all impact the final flavour. Change one, and the taste changes. Tamil is like that, especially the Tamil Perumal Murugan employs. The language in
Kanganam
is like Marimuthu — deeply rooted to the land, deriving its nourishment from it, its accent and flavour. Importing this into English would require an equally flavourful dialect. Not a faithful rendition of the word, but a justice to the spirit.
It is thus a tad unfortunate that we have a very good translation, but not a great retelling.The reviewer is a writer and researcher, with interests in history and archaeology, gender, Internet, and technology.@nadjanadikaResolvePenguin Hamish HamiltonUnderpinning this are the twin systems of caste and patriarchy.

Few in Munnar and its environs haven’t seen or heard of Padayappa, the giant wild tusker which roams the hill-resort and its tea plantations. In fact, tourists, keen on getting a snapshot of him, often enquire about his whereabouts. For his reputation for reasonably good behaviour precedes him wherever he goes.The sight of Padayappa padding down the road will make even the stout-hearted quail — more so if one runs into him on a sharp curve. His appearance is quite formidable. Standing nearly 10 feet tall, his ragged ears flap languidly, his mud-caked flanks heave visibly and his massive tusks protrude menacingly.Yet, local people have faith in Padayappa’s innate goodness. They believe he won’t harm anyone if left untroubled and allowed to eat what he wants. This tolerance sometimes sees him plunder fruit stalls and vegetable gardens at will. When people try to drive him away, he puts on a façade of aggressiveness which he soon sheds, though.Padayappa once sociably barged into a football game. Knowing his amiability, the players stood their ground, albeit cautiously, and after a while he lumbered away, perhaps feeling like an unwanted behemoth among midgets. On another occasion, he graciously accepted a coconut, over a wall, from a discreetly distanced well-wisher. These unbelievable images can be viewed on the Internet.Recently, while driving to Munnar at pre-dawn, we noticed a line of vehicles about 50 metres away, their headlights inexplicably switched off. A closer look revealed Padayappa amiably ambling along ahead of us, hardly 15 metres away. Realising that he was holding up traffic, he soon considerately moved to the very edge of the road. And as we crept past him, I could’ve easily reached out and patted him — he was so near! Yet he showed no signs of truculence.gnettomunnar@rediffmail.co",0,0,0,1

Dear Agony Akka,I am a young man from Tenkasi in Tamil Nadu. Previously, you have replied to a successful woman in her 30s who works from home and is avoiding marriage proposals arranged by parents and brother. You must seethe dangers of the advice you have given to a lady whose ovum production and quality must be already declining in her 30s. If she get married now, chances are still there for her to have a baby but you advise against it. This is the archetype of the ‘Last Man’ or ‘Last Woman’ who don’t have kids, are highly successful urbanites, and travel worldwide to have as much merry as possible without having any heir. It’s the end of their lineage. Becoming mother is the greatest thing for a lady. The parents and brother are doing a favour to get her married soon. You can merry endlessly and retire at 40, but that is waste of youth. You should have advised her to get married. —
Extremely galled guyDear EGG,Your mail has burst in my inbox like a chocolate bomb from your neighbouring town of Sivakasi. And with the same amount of noise and smoke. I am coughing away. In fact, I will need a Cofka lozenge to calm down and respond to your surreal fears about the future of mankind.I am always pleasantly amused that such existential homilies are never expressed by well-meaning men when there is female infanticide in large numbers which, you will agree, takes away the female’s ovum production capacity very early.In my housing society also, there was one such family. The brother was always doing favours for sister. Insisting she gets married. Censoring her phone calls. Slapping her if she came home late. All for her well-being and ovum count. Then the girl found someone to marry. Her senior in college who loved her. But brother did not like this boy. So he did biggest favour and killed them both. As you can imagine, nobody got a chance to find out quality of the woman’s ovum, but since she was in her 20s, it must have been healthy.Just like you, I also get puzzled that young women are not getting excited about cooking husband’s favourite dish and cleaning children’s bums. It is so much more fun than earning fat salaries and travelling worldwide. But alas, more and more young women are saying, you have the motherhood, we will have the merry. They are clearly focussed too much on the here and the now than on the heir and the spare.Then there’s Meera, daughter of the family in Flat 17C. Both parents are working, brother is doing engineering and Meera is doing Computer Science. Naturally, busy family means mother and Meera have to do much cooking. I have often found that Meera is so focussed on making omelettes for family that her own eggs are getting totally bypassed. Will brother finish breakfast and hunt for husband or will he focus on his boiled egg? We don’t know. Suspense is intense.Now with women getting more interested in increasing salary than decreasing ovum, maybe it’s time for men to become single mothers? Adopting, surrogacy, so many lineage options there are these days.Meanwhile, what is certainly having merry is India’s population statistics. Last I checked, it was 1.4 billion, roughly 17% of all human beings in the world. You need not feel afraid of Indian race coming to an early end. There might not be much air to breathe but there are certainly plenty of heirs going around. —

 Not many communities feel a sense of belonging with two countries they view as their own — the Jews call India their motherland, and Israel, their fatherland. So says Ori Z. Soltes in a book he has edited on Bene Israel, Baghdadi and Cochini Jews in India, their customs and lives,
Growing Up Jewish in India
. Offering a historical account through several articles, the complexity of the topic can be gauged from the fact that the preface runs into 18 pages, followed by an introduction on Indian Jews as a diverse diaspora which is almost as long.
The arrivalThe Bene Israel Jews are the largest Jewish Indian community and there are a number of theories regarding the timing of their arrival on the western coast, some dating back to the reign of King Solomon, 3,000 years ago. Another theory is that they were part of the lost 10 tribes that disappeared from north Israel and from history in the aftermath of the conquest of the Israelite kingdom by the Neo-Assyrian Empire. And there are other theories too, which Soltes elaborates on to bring clarity to the matter.The book comprises six chapters including an epilogue aside from a foreword by Ralphy Jhirad. There’s a chapter on Kerala synagogues by Orna Eliyahu-Oron and Barbara C. Johnson; there’s another on the synagogues of Calcutta Baghdadi Jews by Jael Silliman. Soltes writes on ‘Refocus and Return’, Siona Benjamin’s multi-layered art, which dots the book; he also pens the epilogue on the community’s past. Benjamin writes a memoir, ‘How I Turned Blue and Other Stories I Remember Growing up Jewish in India.’Silliman weaves her narrative around the three synagogues of Baghdadi Jews of Calcutta, giving deep insights into the lives of the city’s Jewish community whose numbers have dwindled from 4,500-odd in the mid-20th century to 700 or so in the 1970s and about 20 now.Across the globeBenjamin's piece gives a snapshot of the life of a diasporic Jew. She writes about her grandmother Elizabeth’s long and interesting life journey. Born in Quetta in Pakistan, Elizabeth’s family later migrated to India’s west coast. Her children dispersed to Asia, Africa and North America, perpetuating the idea of the diasporic Jew in a personal way. The distance between the families seemed to widen with her parents in India, most of the family in Israel, a few relatives in the U.S. and Canada, and some in Africa.She remembers that while in India, “I got called everything from a Parsi to Punjabi and even occasionally a cocktail...” In America (she later settled in the U.S.), she was often posed a similar question: ‘Where are you from?’ “So not surprisingly, in my paintings, I also raise the question about what and where is ‘home’ while evoking issues about identity, immigration, motherhood and the role of art in social change,” she writes.Soltes feels, and rightly so, that Benjamin's array of work and her memoir illuminates and carries forward the narrative of the three major Jewish communities in and now outside India. The book is a must read for all as it addresses a complex issue in a rich scholarly way while making it eminently readable.The reviewer is an independent journalistbased in Kolkata.Growing Up Jewish in IndiaNiyogi Books

Hearing his folk music, we children would rush out of the house. He would continue playing in anticipation of the elders to appear. All in the family would soon spread around the settees to see his snake show.He possessed a vast knowledge about not only snakes but most reptiles. His folklore revolved mainly around different species of reptiles. He spoke a tribal dialect but made sure that everyone understood his language and accent. He would open the intricately woven box made of palm leaves in which the snake was kept. As soon as the lid was open, a hissing snake would appear with its hood. In case it was a bit lazy, he would poke its hood with the
Been
for it to show its fangs. We children would shudder in fear. He would reassure everyone and ask us to enjoy the spectacle. His knowledge and lecturing skills could challenge any herpetologist.
It appeared as though he treated our house as a platform to showcase his talent. Much to his liking, everyone paid complete attention. And to the questions posed about snakes, their habitat and prey-base, he took pride in answering calmly.After the show, he would hand in packets containing herbal antidotes to elders with instructions for emergency use.His wife and son were equally well poised and adept in handling snakes.One other reason for this childhood experience etched vividly in my mind is the costumes the snake-charmer and his family wore. A colourful turban-like head gear with complex art work, and multi-hued clothing patterned and pinned with hundreds of sequins gave out an aura. Perhaps, the women in their community were the creators of this unique designer clothing.You would be surprised to know what his expectations were in return for his snake show. He preferred our home-made masala and chutney powders, pickles and other culinary items to money. He would rather demand these things from my grandmother.He would create a loud scene to impress upon her how much he longed to take the masala powders home to share them with his relatives. Everyone at home, despite yielding to his unusual demand, used to find his demanding and dramatic quirks amusing.Before leaving, he would do one routine check for traces of snake movements in and around the house. Almost every one at home used to see them off when he left with his family; such was his charm. What a charming snake-man!sujith_sandur@yahoo.in

The idea of non-violence or ahimsa was central to Mahatma Gandhi’s beliefs. From the railway platform in Pietermaritzburg, to the indigo plantations of Champaran, the response to Chauri Chaura, and the salt march at Dandi, it underpinned his steadfast resistance to injustice and guided him on every step of his leadership of the freedom struggle. If Gandhi’s ahimsa was central to his ethical vision, this vision was situated deep within his religious beliefs, and derived metaphysical force from them. “My politics are subservient to my religion,” he famously stated. At the end of his autobiography
My Experiments with Truth
, he reiterates his commitment to finding truth through ahimsa: “There is no other God than Truth. And if every page of these chapters does not proclaim to the reader that the only means for the realisation of Truth is Ahimsa, I shall deem all my labour in writing these chapters to have been in vain.”
Path to self-fulfilment The autobiography ends in 1921. The instrument of ahimsa became the foundational principle of Gandhi’s project of resistance to British colonial rule in India. Even as he led the political movement, Gandhi was re-interpreting the Hindu religious texts to form his understanding of religion as a way to self-fulfilment. In
Elusive Non-Violence: The Making and Unmaking of Gandhi’s Ahimsa
, Jyotirmaya Sharma takes us through the evolution of Gandhi’s ahimsa through the prism of his religion.
Sharma begins by acknowledging the myths that have been built over the decades around the man; eventually, “Gandhi became his admirers.” Similarly, studying Gandhi’s ethical principles in isolation from his religious beliefs, observes Sharma, can give the impression of paradoxes or inconsistencies in his thought.However, in tracing the evolution of Gandhi’s ahimsa as a fundamentally religious ideal situated within his beliefs about Hinduism, Sharma discovers a profound consistency. He discusses Gandhi’s response and efforts to maintain peace after the murder of Swami Shraddhanand. “Gandhi’s primary concern from the moment he heard the news of the murder was to avert an endless chain of retaliatory killings.”If Gandhi’s politics were shaped by religious belief, his religion was expressed in his actions. As an interpreter and reformer of Hinduism for his times, his religion had less to do with theology and more to do with the heart. At the core of his religion was peace. Which made non-violence central, because the human heart itself was a battlefield: “There are times when Gandhi calls the human heart Kurukshetra, the eponymous battlefield, which is also the dharmakshetra, or the arena of righteousness. How can it be both? It becomes a dharmakshetra when God is invited to reside in it and given its charge. If sin is allowed to flourish in the heart, it becomes the theatre of Kuru.”Sharma describes Gandhi’s ahimsa in terms of a musical raga: “In the ascending sense of ahimsa, the stress falls on non-violent action and violent and non-violent actors. The descending range withdraws from the world of people, giving ahimsa an inward quality. In neither is the overall integrity of the idea lost. It lies in Gandhi’s fidelity to moksha, desireless action, the futility of the body and the centrality of death.”Gandhi constantly reflected upon his beliefs from time to time. His conceptualisation of ahimsa as a political instrument evolved over the years. Writing to C.F. Andrews in 1918, he had expressed his concerns about the tradition of non-violence in India: “All then that can be said... is that individuals have made serious attempts, with greater success than elsewhere, to popularise the doctrine (of non-violence). But there is no warrant for the belief that it has taken deep roots among the people.” How, then, did he bring his unequivocal conception of ahimsa to serve as the directional principle of political action to resist colonial power in a vast and deeply divided society?A part of the answer lies in the long and sustained debates that Gandhi had with others who interrogated his approach. His conceptualisation of ahimsa did not go without challenges. These included questions from Lala Lajpat Rai and B.R. Ambedkar. These debates, which often played out in correspondence — Gandhi was a meticulous letter-writer, always ready to continue engaging in both intellectual and everyday conversations — as well as in the pages of the publications of the freedom movement, are fascinating for what they reveal about the evolution of his political, ethical, and religious ideas as he launched his mass movement based on satyagraha and non-cooperation.Evil or goodOne of the sharpest challenges to Gandhi’s approach came from outside India, in an open letter from the Jewish philosopher Martin Buber in 1939. “I have been very slow in writing this letter to you, Mahatma,” writes Buber. “I cannot help withstanding evil when I see that it is about to destroy the good. I am forced to withstand evil in the world just as the evil within myself.” Buber tells Gandhi that religion brought into politics will vanish into the fire of political expediency. “Man, instead of treading in the path taken by that step of God through history, will run blindly over it.”In this 75th year of Indian independence, it is testimony to the power and reach of Gandhi’s ideas that we are still exploring and reinterpreting his ideals of truth and non-violence.The reviewer is in the IAS.Views are personal.Elusive Non-Violence: The Making and Unmaking of Gandhi’s Religion of AhimsaContext/ Westland

"hina today seems mysterious with its very own version of Communism, Capitalism and Democracy. But the mystery vanishes when we see it through a mythic lens and realise that China functions as it always has, magnificence from behind an expressionless face — the wall.Chinese culture does not claim universality. It is focused on China, isolated from the world by natural and artificial barriers. The former are the snow-capped mountains of the south that circle west and turn into the cold deserts of the north, which then lead into the eastern seas.The artificial barriers are the Great Wall of China built to keep out northern nomads, now transformed as the Great Firewall of China that keeps the world out. As if that was not isolation enough, China was once full of walled cities that thrived along the Yellow (Huang He) river and Yangtze river basins in the heart of China. Bordered by cold grasslands to the north and warm tropical forests to the south, this region had 4,000 walled cities 500 years ago. This, for the Middle Kingdom, was all things under heaven. Everything else was peripheral.Dynasties and kingsThe history of China has always been presented as a well-recorded, elegant sequence of dynasties of over 500 kings, from the mythical past to the present republic, a record maintained by the court. The script was sacred in China, over 3,000 years old. Through it the Emperor and shamans could communicate with the gods. Each royal dynasty sought to uphold the ‘Mandate of Heaven’ and replicate heaven on earth, organising an orderly society in harmony with nature. Otherwise, they risked the displeasure of heaven, revolution by the people, and replacement by more worthy rulers.Many Chinese believe that their superior cultural ways have inspired their neighbours to imitate them and even voluntarily give tribute to the Chinese Emperor. Of course, the neighbours themselves, be it the Japanese, Koreans, Tibetans, or the Vietnamese, don’t agree with this Chinese world-view. That being said, neighbouring cultures do share many features of Chinese culture such as top-down control, cultural inwardness bordering on xenophobia, and a great value placed on nature, filial piety, and ‘saving face’. But, despite its walls, we must never forget that China gave the world rice, silk, tea, paper, printing press and gunpowder.Foreign influenceAnd, despite the Wall, China did succumb to foreign influence. The horse appeared in China around the same time as it did in ancient Egypt and India, 3,500 years ago, in the Shang era. Buddhism entered China 2,000 years ago, in the Han era. Both these became so integral to Chinese culture that no one in China sees the horse or Buddhism as foreign.Yet, at one time, Buddhism met with fierce resistance in royal courts, as it threatened the old ways. Eventually, it integrated itself into the Chinese system, its benevolent side aligning with Confucian thinking, and its occult and mystical side aligning with Taoist rituals. Today, Communist China feels threatened by the influence of Islam to its west and Christianity to its east, and maintains a firm grip on religious ideas.China also had foreign rulers. The Yuan dynasty that ruled China in the 13th century were Mongols from the north, while the Qing, who ruled China from the 17th century until the rise of the Chinese Republic in the 20th century, were Manchu from the northeast. Even though these foreigners adopted the trappings of Chinese culture and insisted they had the Mandate of Heaven to declare themselves Emperor, their presence was tolerated with great resentment.For many in China, only the Han are legitimate rulers. The Han dominated China from 2nd century BCE to 2nd century CE, roughly when the Roman Empire controlled the Mediterranean regions, and the Indo-Greeks, Kushans and Satavahanas controlled South Asia. Even today, Han culture is synonymous with what stands for classical Chinese.History of resistanceChinese history is a history of resistance to fragmentation. Periods without central control have been described by Chinese historians as dark chaotic times of fighting warlords. But these were also times that saw the emergence of great literature, including those that were later grouped as Confucian and Taoist.After centuries of instability and war, China was brutally united by Emperor Qin roughly 2,300 years ago. Qin burnt all books, for he saw ideas as a threat to unification, a belief that prevails even today.Shortly afterwards, China saw the Han period, when centralisation and standardisation became the dominant theme of governance. Confucianism became the favoured state religion, though the peasants preferred to continue with the Taoist faith.This early China did not include the Uighyur and Tibetan regions to the east, which became ‘integral’ to China only in Mongol times 700 years ago.Replete with storiesChina is full of temples to gods, heroes, and ancestors, but the major literature of the Chinese people are semi-historical novels that deal with strategy and tactics of legendary kings and courtiers.Gods and spirits and ancestors thrive in folktales and divinations, but generally leave the affairs of humans to humans. The concept of a single all-powerful god, located outside nature, does not play any role in the Chinese system. What exists is an all-powerful Emperor, on his Dragon Throne, in the Forbidden City. Within this secure, ‘square’ space, he replicates the rituals and the bureaucracy established by the Jade Emperor in ‘circular’ Heaven. Perfection here is copied, not invented. In China, to copy is not seen as stealing as in the West. It is seen as admiration of the best.What distinguishes China from the West is the centrality of nature, hence the idea of interconnectedness of all things. Individuals exist in a system, so there cannot be Western style individualism that is seen as isolationist.In the Confucian way, everyone is answerable to someone else: the subjects to the ruler, children to parents, women to men, juniors to seniors, students to teachers, living to the dead. These are again arranged hierarchically, as a cascade of authority, with the Emperor at the top. Obedience, ritually reinforced, ensures order. Failure to uphold the system brings shame to the family, and is frowned upon by the venerable ancestors, whose shrine is found in most traditional households.The Taoist wayChina is a dominant civilisational force because the Confucian way has an equally powerful counterbalance, the way of the Tao, which is more individualistic, rural, internal and mystical. In the Taoist way, disharmony between the yin and the yang creates disease and despair. So extremes are best avoided.Individualism expresses itself differently in China. In the West, individualism is getting the state to enable individual rights. In China, it is to be invisible to the state: not being predator to the prey or prey to the predator; like a ninja warrior who goes with the flow and so remains unseen. And that’s how most Chinese survive in a regime that demands complete submission to the hierarchy in exchange for order. For nothing matters more in the Chinese scheme of things than cultural order and natural harmony, perhaps not even truth.

"Globe-crossing Michael Palin’s show was inspired by Jules Verne’s classic Around the World in 80 Days.
| Photo Credit: GOOGLE
 1 First published on January 30, 1873,
Around the World in 80 Days
is an epic novel by Jules Verne in which the hero, Phileas Fogg, uses many different modes of transport to achieve his goal. In the book, Fogg encounters a ‘new’ vehicle but drops the idea. Only in 1956, after a David Niven film changed the story, do we see Fogg using this transport. What mode of travel was this that came into existence a 100 years earlier, thanks to the Montgolfier brothers in France?
2 William Perry Fogg, an American adventurer who was the inspiration for Phileas Fogg, was one of the first people from the West to travel across the globe, which he chronicled in letters known as ‘Round the World.’ After travelling through Japan, China and Penang, he arrived in India. After spending some time in Bombay he became one of the first tourists to travel through a recently opened technological wonder that led him to the Great Pyramids. Through what he had travelled, which opened in 1969, thanks to French engineers?3 The Jules Verne Trophy is awarded to the team that circumnavigates the globe fastest using a particular mode of transport, one that Fogg never uses in the book. First awarded in 1993 to Team Explorer, which took 79 days and six hours, currently IDEC Sport holds the record for circling the world in 40 days, 23 hours, 30 minutes and 30 seconds. By what mode of transport do these teams go around the world?4 Fogg boarded a steamship in Hong Kong which in six days took him to Yokohama. This ship in real life was one of the first steamships to use a compound engine, which allowed it to be one of the fastest of its time. Originally it was supposed to be called the ‘Mysore’ but it got its name from a Dravidian word that means ‘black country’. This was a reference to the black soil prevalent in the southern Deccan region. What was the name of the ship, a term that you would now associate more with music?5 The Overland Route, which was opened in 1869, was one of the technological breakthroughs that happened, which allowed Verne to plan his adventure. Stretching 3,075 km long, it was built by three private companies over public lands and mostly by Chinese immigrants who did all the manual labour. Known as the first transcontinental railroad, which country’s vast lands did this railroad cross?6 In 1872 an English businessman organised the first around-the-world tourist trip, lasting seven months. The journey was described in a series of letters known as ‘Letter from the Sea and from Foreign Lands, Descriptive of a Tour Round the World’. Though these have a passing resemblance to Verne’s book, it is believed it was too late to influence Verne or could have been nothing more than an inspiration. Who was this businessman who started a travel agency in his name known for its tours and travels?7 George Francis ____ was an American entrepreneur who organised the Union Pacific Railroad, a horse tramway company in England, and in 1870 made a trip around the world, which shared a lot of the details with the book. In his own words, ‘Verne stole my thunder. I’m Phileas Fogg’. His family name, refers to a form of transport that he (in real life) and Fogg in the book hired entirely. What name/ transport is this, which helped them reach their goals overland? 8 When Fogg reaches India he boards a train from Bombay to Calcutta, which was part of the new linking of the Indian railways across the sub-continent (1870). Unfortunately an article in the
Daily Telegraph
misleads him as he realises 80 km of track just before Allahabad hadn’t been built yet. Finally his trusty co-traveller Passepartout manages to source a particular animal which, though expensive, Fogg buys and rides to Allahabad. What animal do they ride memorably?
9 Mark Beaumont holds the Guinness world record in his chosen field having completed his trip around the world of 29,000 km on September 18, 2017, in less than 79 days. The trip started in Paris, crossing Russia, Mongolia, across Australia, North America and then Portugal. Using a Koga-Kimera loaded with about 30 kg of equipment he averaged 380 km a day. On what vehicle did he do this epic journey? 10 In the
BBC
series
Around the World in 80 Days with Michael Palin
, Monty Python member Palin and a five-person crew try to follow Fogg’s route as closely as possible. One of the most memorable episodes is #6, where he is on a container ship crossing the Pacific Ocean. During the trip, an unusual ceremony happens where the crew cover him with tomato paste, flour, eggs, curry powder etc. The reason for this ceremony is also the same reason why Fogg wins his bet eventually. What was the reason?

 With a ringside view of events in the run-up to Bangladesh’s liberation war as a cub reporter of the Calcutta newspaper,
The Statesman
, Manash Ghosh’s book
Bangladesh War: Report from Ground Zero
is a page-turner. It turned out to be a serendipitous assignment when Ghosh was sent to cover the Second Asian Highway Car Rally (November 15, 1970), to the India-East Pakistan border at Petrapole-Benapole, where he ran into people willing to disclose what was happening in then East Pakistan.
From them, he gleaned information on reasons that led to Field Marshal Ayub Khan’s downfall, caused mostly by a mass upheaval in East Pakistan, General Yahya Khan’s rise to power, and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s six-point autonomy movement. They also foretold the tumult ahead. Ghosh’s article about the gathering storm in East Pakistan was titled ‘When Brother meets Brother’ and aroused a lot of interest.With Bengalis “yearning for a Bengali nation,” Pakistan began to prepare a military blueprint to “break the back of [the] Mujib-led secessionist movement.” Led by Lt Gen. Khadim Hussain Raza and Lt Gen. Tikka Khan, Pakistan launched Operation Searchlight in March 1971, a military action to curb the Bengali nationalist movement which left lakhs of people dead and resulted in nearly 10 million fleeing the country as refugees. It was a pity, the author notes, that initially neither the Indian nor the international media took reports of the killings or the exodus seriously, even as UNI journalists began filing reports of refugees fleeing East Pakistan, the blasting of the Bengali language martyr memorial Shahid Minar and other atrocities.Ghosh, first acting on his own and then teaming up with a senior colleague, went to the border to find out details, and got to knowGolak Bihari Majumdar(then DG BSF Eastern Command who played a key role in leading many of Sheikh Mujib government’s men to safety to Calcutta)and Petrapole Commandant K.B. Singh. Singhhad once asked Ghosh to accompany an Italian company official to Calcutta and put him up at a hotel. The Italian had somehow managed to escape the carnage in Dhaka to reach the border. The Italian’s story too would make the front page, and earn him a pat from his editor who asked Ghosh officially to report on East Pakistan.Diplomatic coupGhosh narrates stories of tacit assistance to the struggle by India and the diplomatic coup when it was revealed to the world that a Bangladesh government-in-exile was working out of Calcutta. He writes that when Tajuddin Ahmed, appointed Prime Minister by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, (after unilateral declaration of Bangladesh’s Independence in March, 1971) met Prime MinisterIndira Gandhi, seeking military intervention by India, she informed him that India would help when the time was appropriate. Ghosh also explains how the Indian Armyraised and trained the Mukti Bahini, “a force composed wholly of Bengali youth, who had sought shelter in India.” The External Affairs Ministry had opened its branch secretariat in Calcutta, headed by a seasoned Bengali diplomat, Ashoke Roy who became Ghosh’s news source. Ghosh came to know, for instance, how RAW’s (Research and Analysis Wing) vigil frustrated a counter plan to thwart Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Gen. Yahya had been able to identify those in the Awami League-led “provisional government” who could play the role of a Trojan horse in future and help him derail the “so-called liberation war.” Although Gen. Yahya’s moves did not succeed then, recalls Ghosh, “it marked the beginning of the process to take Bangladesh in the reverse direction. Four years later, it culminated in the assassination of Sheikh Mujib and almost his entire family.” Ghosh’s account of his adventurous trip across the Padma river in a small boat to cover a daring raid on the Sarda Police Academy by the

 A university is a community of teachers, students, researchers and administrators together engaged in pursuing the goal of higher education: the creation and sharing of knowledge. But who is admitted into its fold? What does it take to learn in a world where social capital is protected by gatekeepers, and knowledge measured out in the form of credentials? “Education is big business in this country,” says a character in
The Middle Finger
. “A lecture here, a workshop there, it never ends. People bleeding profits out of people’s anxieties.”
 Saikat Majumdar’s new novel, an exploration of the ethics of education, raises fundamental questions as it invokes the story of Eklavya from the
Mahabharata
. In the epic, Eklavya is the young tribal boy, a prince of the Nishada tribe, who offers his thumb as
guru dakshina
to his teacher, Dronacharya. In the version quoted in the epigraph to Majumdar’s novel, Arjuna urges Eklavya to give up his right thumb for his guru, but Drona blesses the Bhil boy to continue shooting arrows despite the thumb.
Strikes a chord The other epigraph is from Plato’s
Symposium
. Socrates tells Agathon that it would be wonderful if knowledge could be attained simply by touching the wise: “If only wisdom were like water, which always flows from a full cup into an empty cup when we connect them with a piece of yarn — well, then, I would consider it the greatest prize to have the chance to lie down next to you.”
The protagonist is Megha, an Indian woman who has drifted out of the doctoral programme at Princeton, which, she felt, was absurd and suffocating. Like “Hogwarts for adults... where a white brilliance hung like a dull haze over the campus and after a while you longed to breathe.” She now teaches basic English writing to students at a U.S. State university. She also writes powerful poetry, which is performed in basement pubs, on YouTube and Instagram. “Poems happened. The bleak landscape outside her window, the old-fashioned steam heater in her studio apartment, the oddly high ceilings, the aching confinement. They pushed poetry out, fine and slimy.” She is awarded an arts fellowship, but remains uncertain about the future: “Nobody could make a life out of poetry.”One evening as she drifts, she meets a group of well-connected Indians on the way to an event at Wellesley — the kind of people who always know each other, are sure of themselves, and are comfortable on any continent. Their presence strikes a chord. At the urging of her professor, Megha returns to Delhi to help set up a new private university which caters to well-heeled Indian students. “This was a new kind of a college where students from all over India wandered in on their way to Oberlin, Yale or Williams... this new college, obscenely expensive for most Indians, was obscenely cheap for them, so what to do with the money?”Megha decides that she will play the game. The new university is located in an old city with ancient hierarchies. It sets out to do bold new things with its teaching programmes, because, as a character remarks, “Literature sits uneasy in India. English is taught the way the British wanted it taught in the 19th century.”But it is not that easy to shake free of old ways. “It was pretty amazing that this was a university where faculty members could call for coffee and a liveried pantry staff brought it to you on a tray. On the other hand, it was coffee made with instant coffee powder and tasted sad.”Sealed off worldsMegha happens to meet Poonam, a woman who helps her set up her house and arrange her bookshelves. They come from entirely different, almost hermetically sealed off worlds. “What would she and Poonam talk about?” wonders Megha. Poonam has the autodidact’s hunger for knowledge. She arranges and rearranges books on Megha’s bookshelves, touching the books as if to absorb their words and ideas: “She liked books in a way Megha did not quite understand.”Poonam, too, is a teacher: she runs a study group at her church for women from Jharkhand who work in houses in Delhi but don’t know how to read or write. She herself has never been to college: “I can’t talk about it. It still hurts.” She wants Megha to teach her: “I want to say my own things.” But Megha does not know how, and says so: “I’m not very good at teaching the language. Teaching literature at the university is very different, Poonam.” But then she notices Poonam leafing through the pages of an A.K. Ramanujan volume. “Why did Poonam want to read poetry? Was there poetry for her?”Is there poetry for those who have not been ‘taught’ to read it? Are there ways in which poetry can reach out and ‘touch’ a reader, as Socrates says to Agathon? This is the question at the heart of this novel. The answer, of course, is yes; because, as one of the characters realises, “There are different ways one can exist in the world.”The reviewer is in the IAS.The Middle FingerSimon & Schuster IndiaIs there poetry for those who have not been ‘taught’ to read it?

"Together Nandana (left) with Nabaneeta Dev Sen. Special Arrangement
| Photo Credit: Anusua Mukherjee
 Academic and littérateur Nabaneeta Dev Sen was the life of Bengal’s literary circles till her death in 2019. The Padma Shri and Sahitya Akademi winner wrote poetry, novels, short stories, plays, literary criticism, travelogues, translations, and children’s books. But she identified herself as a poet, as her daughter Nandana Dev Sen, also a writer and poet, says in the introduction to a recently released poetry collection,
Acrobat,
which contains poems Nabaneeta wrote in English, a few she translated from Bengali, and some she translated with Nandana. The majority are, however, Nandana’s independent translations of poems Nabaneeta composed over six decades.
Nandanasays in the poignant introduction: “If my mother were introducing this book to you herself, as I had fervently hoped she would, I know she would have begun by telling you how deeply she believed in the vital necessity of poetry, and in every freedom it delivers: ‘I speak for poetry as being central to a woman’s freedom. Yes, I am partial, I cannot be and do not wish to be objective in this one respect...’” The poems are expressions of deeply felt emotions told in a language sharp, controlled and precise. Excerpts from an interview with Nandana Dev Sen:You must have seen Nabaneeta writing. What was her creative process like? Did she have a favourite space — a room or a desk or a nook — where she always wrote? Ma carried her
kobitar khata
(poetry notebook) everywhere, so she was always prepared for poetry to come to her — and it often did in the oddest of hours and places. At home, she loved to write on her bed (which had belonged to my poet grandmother Radharani Debi), with all her papers spread out around her. In fact, Ma wrote many books poring over her notes, sprawled out on that bed. Her other favourite spot was the beautiful antique desk of my grandfather Narendra Dev (also a beloved writer). Ma was often up all night writing, and she had to write each and every day. She often said that a day without writing was for her “a sad day,” a barren day.
In the Introduction, you mention Nabaneeta saying that there aren’t enough English translations of Indian regional literatures. In the last few years, translation has seen a resurgence. Did she notice the change? What did she say?Yes, Ma was very glad to see that the urgency (and artistry) of translation was finally getting more attention in India, a trend that has in turn motivated talented translators to become much more proactive. Although she wrote beautifully in English, Ma insisted on writing in Bengali, and spent a lot of time translating other Indian writers (especially women poets) because she felt that Indian books in the mother tongue were at risk of becoming obsolete, and were insufficiently shared with international readers (or even with other Indians).She pointed out that the literature of our nation was almost exclusively represented in the world by the new Indian writing in English, which she admired as much as she loved our rich regional literatures. It’s certainly a cause for celebration that excellent translations are becoming more available now and that translators have much more support and recognition now than they had even a few years ago. But there is still a huge gap between what we need and what we have.Nabaneeta has seminal studies on the position of women in Indian literature. Much of your activism is centred on the girl child. Is it your way of carrying forward Nabaneeta’s legacy?I’m sure it is, even if I may not have consciously connected my activism to Ma’s pathbreaking work, but both my mother and my grandmother were formidable feminists. Much of Ma’s academic and creative work had a strong focus on social justice and women’s equality, as did the poetry of Radharani Debi (a child widow who remarried, most scandalously, and reinvented herself as a bestselling poet). Throughout her career, Ma wrote stunningly powerful poems (and fiction) that spoke out against gender-based violence and injustice, many of which are included in
Acrobat.
I don’t doubt that the way I was raised by them both had a great deal to do with my interest in girl-child protection, especially the fight to stop child marriage and to end violence against women and girls, which, as we know, are huge and frightening crises in our country.

"Lively A parade by Goan women during a traditional carnival. Getty images/ IStock
| Photo Credit: RADIOKUKKA Anusua Mukherjee
 There’s a Goa beyond picture postcard images of white beaches, lush fields and palm trees. It finds expression in the works of memoirist, teacher and writer Maria Aurora Couto, whom we lost recently. Steeped in history, her oeuvre includes in its sweep the fractious present and anxieties about the future of Goa. In her books, especially
Goa: A Daughter’s Story
and
Filomena’s Journeys: A Portrait of a Marriage, a Family & a Culture
, she chronicled the history of her community and the transformations within Goan — never Goanese — society after the arrival of the Portuguese in 1510.
 From her father Dr. Francisco de Figueiredo, popularly known as Chico, who traded medicine for music and taught at the Portuguese Lyceum before the family moved to Dharwad in 1945, she inherited the Goan soul or
alma
— “which may literally mean soul but... is also meant to communicate passion.” In
Filomena’s Journeys,
her mother Filomena Borges comes across as both serene and strong. Couto taught English literature and travelled extensively, staying in Panjim for three years after Goa’s liberation, before finally settling down in her husband’s ancestral village, Aldona.
Composite identity “Contradiction and paradox best describe the extraordinary experience of my life in Goa in those first years after Liberation,” she recalls in
Goa: A Daughter’s Story
. “I was Maria, wife of the first development commissioner of Goa, Alban Couto… And I was Aurora, Chico’s daughter. Aurora, the daughter coming home, wrestled with Maria, now wife of an officer in the new dispensation.”
But Goans, she writes, are very conscious of a “composite identity”, which is an Indian identity with deep European influences. Many are fluent in at least three languages — Konkani, English and Portuguese (though, after liberation, the use of the coloniser’s tongue was discouraged, unlike English in the mainland). Couto establishes the links which developed in response to conversion and colonisation in Goa. She explains how, in spite of being divided along religious lines by Portuguese colonial policies, Goan society retained communal harmony, thanks to a strong sense of community.Arrivals and departuresThere were waves of changes, brought on by centuries of Christianisation, invasions by Marathas, revolts of villagers, uprisings of Goan clerics and Hindu feudal lords against Portuguese policies. Responding to the challenge of living as a Christian in India and as a Catholic in Goa, Couto stresses on the “tradition of India, which allows for fantastic inclusiveness.” Goa is a state of mind, says Couto. “It is life lived without feeling circumscribed by geography or by time.”For the Goan, writes Couto, the spirit of the place is embodied in the village, its red earth and pouring rain, its rivers (Mandovi, Zuari and others), forests, birds, trees and stones. “It is personified in the deities in the prayer rooms and the altars at homes, in roadside shrines, and in the churches and temples.” Goa’s history is layered with arrivals and departures, victory and defeat, colonisers and settlers, and Couto narrates it through the prism of an insider-outsider (having lived away for years before heading home). It is possible to hear young men singing the
mando
and
dulpod
(sung after the
mando
in quick rhythm, typically describing everyday Goan life, especially of Christians) in Konkani; and then listen to the soulful, anguished voice of the
fado
in Portuguese, a musical expression of man’s inner being — poetic, lyrical and tragic in its intensity. “The Goan loves a peaceful enjoyment of leisure. Work is important. So is leisure and a life whose every moment is to be savoured” — a
susegad
or laidback attitude to life. Through her writing, Couto communicates a feeling of
socego
(a sense of peace and tranquillity unique to the Goan) that lingers despite all the struggles of existence.
 But Goa is no longer a tranquil garden. Couto was particularly worried about its fragile environment, which has not been shielded against invasive tourists, and the lack of a sense of history and heritage. Will Goans be able to protect their unique
Goemkarponn
? It’s up to them, says Couto, to wake up to the realities and fight for the survival of what remains.
The writer looks back at one classic every month.The Goan loves a peaceful enjoyment of leisure. Work is important. So is leisure

Do women have complete access to public spaces in Indian cities?Whenever I wait for a friend in a public space, I tend to scroll through my phone for no reason or I pretend to be engaged in a call. A lot of us choose to wait in places such as bus stops or cafes to indicate to others that we are here for a reason,avoiding the judgmental gaze.So why are women bound by the need to present a purpose to be in public? It is because of the narrow assumption that women who loiter are “undesirable”.Why Loiter? Women & Risk on Mumbai Streets
critically analyses women’s access to public spaces. Even 11 years after being published, the book stands relevant for analysing women’s safety and the idea of equality in public spaces. The findings in the books are drawn from a three-year research project, the gender and space project that focused on women and public space in Mumbai. Shilpa Phadke, Sameera Khan and Shilpa Rande, through the book, show how women are denied equal claim to public spaces in cities and look into the structural subordination of women in public spaces. The book is divided into four parts, covering every aspect of lack of inclusiveness of public spaces and the risks that comes with it. The book maps the class, caste, gender, religious and regional stratification affecting women’s public access. Although the book is based on Mumbai streets, the insights and findings of the authors become relatable to women living in other cities of our country.
No inclusivityWomen face a wide range of problems in public spaces from lack of inclusive designs of public infrastructure to the age-old patriarchal mindset and ideas. With the rise in violence against women in public spaces, it is crucial for the planners to design inclusive public spaces, catering to the needs of everyone in society. Public space should be all inclusive. The book urges women to celebrate loitering and taking risks. It is important for women to claim their rightful access and have fun in public spaces.lakshmitharayil22@gmail.com

I feel sad and uneasy when I catch sight of my old walking stick in a corner in my bedroom. It wears a mournful look. It was my constant companion until four months ago when my daughter brought me a sophisticated three-wheeler walker with brakes, a thing of beauty, which I couldn’t resist.That stick was also a gift from my daughter seven years earlier when I, at 86, had become quite wobbly in the U.K. She had demonstrated to me its virtues: its height was adjustable; it was collapsible; and it would come in handy on flights for, unlike regular sticks, it could be stowed away under the seat.That stick had served me well, particularly after I had found a new use for it on my visit to India. During my month-long stay in my Thrissur apartment, an elderly couple from Mumbai chanced to visit me with their three-year-old granddaughter, Malati. The child was cross with her grandparents and sat all bunched up in a chair some 10 feet from me, sulking.I noticed her eyeing my stick. I casually picked it up and pretended to examine it closely while at the same time carrying on a conversation with her grandfather.I held the stick in my hands at its lowest joint and, feigning to use great force, “broke” it and folded the loose part to the parent body with great care. I saw from the corner of my eye that Malati’s jaw had dropped. Another break, and Malati was at my side. Without paying any attention to her I held up the four-part stick by its handle and let go of my grip on the loosened parts. The parts clicked into place and the stick resumed its normal state.“Can I try?” Malati piped up.‘By all means, go ahead!’The stick had magically broken the ice.That was nearly four years ago. I was back in India again a year later for medical treatment. I had thus had many more occasions to repeat my performance with the stick, which never failed me. Then came COVID-19 and a near total ban on visitors. And I was stuck in Thrissur.The stick keeps moping in its corner.

 A poet is a prosaic lover, writes author Mihir Vatsa in his debut non-fiction,
Tales of Hazaribagh
. “Talent lodges itself, useless, against love’s gaze,” he says. Love is an important way of understanding Vatsa’s gaze on his hometown and Jharkhand’s hill station, Hazaribagh. This book is all about Hazaribagh, a place that does not occur much on lists of places to see in India.
Vocabulary of loveIn this self-assured debut, Vatsa is possessive about his Hazaribagh, yet refusing to do the obvious — to romanticise or prettify it. In resisting the travelogue trope of rose-tinted glasses, he chooses not to condescend on the present. His gaze is not just his view of the landscape — plateau dotted with a town, lakes, waterfalls and rocky escarpments — but is also responsive to how the area changes him. What we get in this frequently surprising book is a vocabulary of love for a home which cannot always stand steadfast to the forces of change.One such change is the naming of Hazaribagh as headquarters of north Chhotanagpur division — now seen just as HQ, and not as a plateau or the place with a thousand gardens. He writes: “I see an active erasure of history, an erasure of poetry too. The history of administration in Hazaribagh started because of the plateau, not in spite of it. Its recent identification as merely a headquarters town marks a fundamental shift in its perception. It tells me that Hazaribagh could soon be another tier-3 city with its made-up parks, ersatz ponds, token forest, shorn increasingly of its inherent beauty.” But towns and cities belong to many, not just to those who love them for their inherent, or integral beauty. The beauty of a fiercely personal love for public things (like places) is to look for the hidden, and to treasure it once found.Tales of Hazaribagh
has several quests at its heart — like finding waterfalls. Unlike other solitary male quests — much of colonial nature writing in India, for example — the author’s changing personas ensure that we are not hearing just one authoritative, all-knowing voice. He is at once a ‘Hazaribagh bro’, a ‘literature student fascinated by irony’, and a ‘millennial’. In effect, this means he takes the view seriously, but not his view of himself. This reminds me of another fine 2021 book,
The Braided River
by Samrat X, which also employs a lightness of touch in the narrative persona.
Gentle exploration Like the Brahmaputra in
The Braided River
— and like waterfalls that swell with surprise in the monsoon —
Tales
is marbled through with a gentle notion of exploration which is not in a hurry to get anywhere. When we read a book, or watch a movie, we are often told it is action, or a thriller, or a romance. We go in expecting
events
. A memoir-travelogue like this one defies the idea of events, and instead relies on the way things actually unfold at their own pace. Thus, there are walks where nothing is found. The unfolding of a non-event is an important part of life — and this little book knows it. It is repetitive in parts, and I wonder if this is a deliberative narrative device. I would also be interested in reading such a narrative through the gaze of a woman, such as the author’s mother, who is frequently mentioned.
But read this book and enjoy a new form of non-chauvinistic, deeply immersive writing. Find a place in India that is neither too beautiful nor too popular, but is always interesting.The reviewer is a conservation biologist and the author ofWild and Wilful.Tales of HazaribaghSpeaking Tiger

 Books on international relations are written either by former diplomats, who take up writing as a hobby, or scholars, who pursue research and analysis as a profession. Diplomats tend to reminisce on their experiences, linking them with the history of the country concerned and provide personal accounts of their accomplishments, which are a useful source material for scholars, who do not have the opportunity to deal with events and personalities. Rajiv Bhatia, a consummate diplomat, in his monumental work,
India-Africa Relations, Changing Horizons
, has taken on the mantle of the scholar, rather than the diplomat. Autobiographical elements in the book are few and far between.
Yen, past linksTo take the case of Kenya, where Bhatia and I served, our bilateral relations were correct and cordial at best as Kenya was preoccupied with seeking development assistance from developed countries and our modest assistance programme, to which they had to contribute a share, was not very attractive to them. When we sought the Kenyan vote in a crucial election against Japan for a non-permanent seat at the Security Council, President Arap Moi told me frankly that Japan had raised bilateral assistance substantially in return for his vote. Kenya did not feel obliged to support India as a developing country, with which it had historical and sentimental ties. The yen mattered more than the linkages of the past.Former Foreign Secretary Krishnan Srinivasan, in his foreword, has outlined the hazards of treating Africa as a Union, since it is a continent of diverse nations and India’s relations with each country has to be studied separately. Bhatia identifies only 15 countries with which India had substantial interactions in spite of the non-aligned and commonwealth links. On the issue of expansion of the permanent membership of the Security Council, Africa, with its demand for two permanent seats to be rotated in the region, has created considerable confusion.The book concentrates on the first two decades of the 21stcentury, which came after I left the continent and, therefore, his sympathetic and hopeful narration of the period and his hopes for the future offer helpful new insights for readers like me. “The emerging economies, such as China and India, led the charge. Yet the old challenges persisted. It was against this backdrop that those arguing for Afro-realism proved convincing; their principal conclusion was that Africa was performing well, but it needed to do much better,” says Bhatia.The global attention and competition among major players like the European Union, Japan, Korea, India and China have given rise to expectations that the next century belongs to Africa and that Africa will grow dramatically by 2035. At the same time, a more realistic assessment is that as many as 22 African countries were classified as having a low level of readiness to benefit from the technological revolution sweeping the world. “In view of the substantial gap between aspirations of the future and achievements so far, it may be tempting for some to mock or dismiss Africa’s prospects. However, a respectful and empathetic attitude is recommended,” says Bhatia. He admiringly quotes Cyril Ramaphosa, President of South Africa, as having said in 2019: “This is Africa’s century, and we want to utilize it to good effect.”The dawn of the new century marked a “scramble for Africa” and India was also compelled to move on from the political, ideological, peacekeeping, development assistance and cultural cooperation to new areas of technological cooperation. We had to contend with the scramble and unregulated competition from major and middle powers. China was in a class by itself, with the formation of a Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in October 2000 with an ambitious programme.India’s roleBhatia has devoted a large part of his book to the rationale, the details and the impact of India’s Africa cooperation programme. Prime Minister Modi asserted that “India is honoured to be a development partner for Africa. It is a partnership beyond strategic concerns and economic benefits. It is formed from the emotional bonds we share and the solidarity we feel for each other.”Africa has also welcomed the increase in the number of visits of Indian dignitaries to Africa and the Indian decision to open new diplomatic missions in Africa. But Bhatia points out that, in the light of the Chinese experience, India should deepen the political commitment to Africa, set aside sizeable financial resources and increase our capability for project execution.Many dimensionsThe continental, regional, bilateral, diaspora and other dimensions of India-Africa cooperation have been analysed in detail to show the prospects for Africa in the coming years. It is inevitable that de-globalisation, debt and digitalisation, the three mega trends in the world will shape Africa’s economic future. India has special capabilities in these areas.Bhatia has established beyond doubt that India-Africa relations have grown from strength to strength and that the future is promising. But he has also admitted that there are many milestones to cross before it can be claimed credibly that “India and Africa are among the highest priorities for each other.” The reality is that strategically, politically and economically, India and Africa are still far apart and much more needs to be done.The reviewer is a Former Ambassador, and Director General, Kerala International Centre.India-Africa Relations, Changing HorizonsRoutledge

"Victim Threats to the sleek creatures also come in the form of declining fish stocks and competition with fishermen. Sushant Dey
| Photo Credit: Sushant Dey
Nachiket Kelkar, as an undergraduate studying zoology, became intrigued on reading about the Ganges river dolphin. The species cannot see its fishy prey or even its own young. Reduced to tiny pits, the eyes at the most detect light or its absence. Virtual blindness is not a disability nor does it slow the animal in the silt-laden turbid Ganges and the Brahmaputra rivers. The aquatic mammal locates its meal with its inbuilt sonar, emitting high-frequency clicks and using its fluid-filled melon-shaped head to detect their reflection off objects. In shallow waters, it swims on its side, a rare ability for a member of the family of whales, porpoises, and dolphins. Kelkar thought it seemed so different from its popular relatives, the seafaring dolphins.Why do these streamlined animals swim on their sides? Do the calves find prey with echolocation or by some other means? The researcher studied the river dolphin for his master’s thesis, but what he discovered in the lower Gangetic floodplains of Bihar changed the trajectory of his enquiry.“I went from sensory ecology to studying political ecology of the species,” he says.When social and political issues on land affected these aquatic animals, understanding those impacts gained more urgency than studying their biology.Threats to the sleek mammals zing from many directions: declining fish stocks, competition with fishermen, and death in fishing nets. The river dolphin, locally called soans, is more valuable dead than alive to fishermen, who use the stinky oil from the blubber to catch catfish. In the past, they hunted the animals, but conservationists convinced them to stop the practice. The deliberate killing of these aquatic mammals may be declining, but inadvertent drowning in fishing nets continues.EntangledA 65-kilometre stretch of the waterway called the Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary, the only one of its kind for India’s national aquatic animal, is a reserve only in name. Catching fish is not allowed within a conservation area, where fishermen can’t help fishing.Dependent for generations on the river and with no other means of subsistence, they cast their nets in the same spots where dolphins hunt, competing for the same catch. The commonly used gillnets with less than 40-mm mesh size are illegal, making the local enterprise an offence twice over. But the legal large-gap nets entangle dolphins that then drown. The fine-mesh gillnets create an invisible curtain underwater that the aquatic mammals can detect and then swerve.Besides these immediate dangers, pollution, dams, and the vagaries of climate have a much more telling impact on fisheries and the soans.It’s a wonder that any Ganges river dolphins survive in this abused and densely human-populated waterway. “Conservation and livelihoods are at serious and violent odds,” says the researcher.To give the species a fighting chance, Kelkar and his colleagues could have lobbied for fishing to be shut down, poachers prosecuted, and nets confiscated. That would be the way of conventional conservation. But they sympathised with the poor fishermen who had few other options. Criminal gangs threatened these marginalised people and appropriated much of their meagre catch. They beat and even killed anyone who resisted. Caught between thugs and paltry returns, many fishermen set aside their nets and migrated to cities to work on construction sites and factory production lines.A struggle“Studying river dolphins led me to engage with fishing communities, their history, and how they relate with the animals,” says the researcher. “Typically, this is not what a biologist is taught to do. It’s been an enriching struggle.”Instead of further victimising the remaining fishers, Kelkar and his team recommend that the authorities allow fishing nets in which soans are least likely to drown. Offering incentives for reporting dolphin by-catch could open an opportunity for dialogue with these communities. Regular monitoring of the river by wildlife authorities may curtail gang activities and keep an eye out for dead dolphins.Perhaps these measures would offer a glimmer of light that even the soans can see.

"aasanthi, one of Tamil Nadu’s best-known writers, has novels, short stories, travelogues and political biographies to her name. Her latest book is a collection of 15short stories, translated from the original Tamil. The stories reflect her preoccupations — social injustice, human right violations, communal harmony and compassion.A short story does not have the luxury of a novel, where the writer can create many layers to establish the central character and events. The short story has to be direct. The reader too has to work a little harder to understand the atmosphere being created. However, there is something soul-satisfying in a well-crafted short story of the kind Vaasanthi writes.These are not easy, happy stories. Most of them centre on women, how they are crushed in a patriarchal society. But her women usually fight back. So, there is a glimmer of hope in some of the stories. ‘Murder’ is about a large clan somewhere in rural Tamil Nadu. The family is under the iron grip of the
paterfamilias
, the ancient Somaiya Thaatha. He controls the land, which is in his name, and has very rigid ideas about women’s place in the household, which is to serve men. No one dares to cross him. Women and the girl children in the family find themselves in an untenable position. Tragedies are bound to happen.
‘Poison’ is a gut-wrenching story about female infanticide, which was fairly common in the southern districts of Tamil Nadu until recently. When the woman whose job it is to do away with the girl child feels she has had enough, the unthinkable happens.But in this eclectic collection, some stories make you hope and smile too.In ‘He came’, two young men, a Hindu and a Muslim, discover that humanity exists when they undertake the long trek home during the first lockdown, after being booted out of their jobs overnight.However, one wishes that some of the translations were not so literal and had lived up to the flavours of the original.The reviewer is a journalist and author.Ganga’s Choiceand other StoriesNiyogi Bo",0,0,0,1

Dear Agony Akka,I am a radiologist (the doctor who does your ultrasounds) nearing my 30s. I am thinking of getting married this year to the love of my life. But I am anxious about the events after marriage. For instance, now my mother wakes me up, cooks breakfast for me, etc. After marriage, should I ask my wife to do so? Would this be patriarchal because she is also a doctor. On the other hand, mother cooking for both of us could be odd. What should I do? What is the way forward?—Caring and Anxious DoctorDear CAD,Thefact that we have reached a stage of evolution where an Indian man is asking whether or not an action of his might be considered patriarchal is a great day in the life of the nation. I want to give you a trophy, throw a party, break into song. Sadly, I cannot even shake your hand warmly because of the pandemic. Be assured, however, that mentally I am doing just that.I am also congratulating you for writing to me with your question and not asking the love of your life. Somehow I feel that she would not have taken it in a friendly spirit of detached interest in male progress.All this is for the asking part of your letter. Now for the question itself. I was spellbound to see how entirely you were missing from that charming home life scenario you painted. It was like reading a ghost story where there is always a spirit or poltergeist or gremlin that is not present but always hovering nearby and must be propitiated with food and incense every day.As you imagine married life unrolling from Day 1, you have visualised your future wife and present mother vying to do the honours of waking you up and cooking your breakfast but where are you? Why aren’t you present there in that scene waking yourself up and cooking your breakfast?The last I heard, alarm clock technology had advanced by leaps and bounds. In fact, you can even record your mother’s loving voice and make it the alarm tune in your phone. As a qualified radiologist, I am sure you will crack the modus operandi in no time. When you are nearing 30, you are even past the globally recognised grace time that Indian men are allowed to fully grow up. Get an alarm.Mind you, you’re not alone. I once met a NRI guy who travelled regularly to India on business and his wife had to call him from Texas to wake him up each morning. Indian men are truly sui generis.Anyway, now that you’re awake, let’s move on. The two options you so elegantly state are between your mother and your wife making your breakfast. Even though it appears from your question that you are worried about these two women and who should do the cooking, if I do an ultrasound of your letter, it becomes crystal clear that you are actually and primarily worried about how to continue your own comfortable life without any unpleasantness coming between you and your aloo paratha.Let me assure you that neither the biological fact of being male nor the study of radiology prevents you from cooking breakfast. Unless you’re worried that the aloo paratha will become radioactive? This is a valid fear but one that scientists will reject outright.The year is still young. Fix marriage for November and use these nine months to discover how the least odd thing in your life will be to look after yourself.— AAagony.akka@gmai",0,0,0,1

1 February 6, 60 AD, is the earliest date in human history for which we know for certain what day of the week it was. We know this because of a piece of graffiti in a city in Italy. It identifies this day as ‘a dies Solis’ (Sunday), by a system, that corresponds to modern day Wednesday after adjusting calendars. The reason this early record was clearly preserved was because of a tragic event that happened 19 years later that preserved the graffiti in thick ash and pumice. In which city would you find this historical record?2 On February 6, 1685, James II of England and VII of Scotland was proclaimed King upon the death of his brother Charles II. He had proved to be an able administrator through his actions during the Great Fire of 1666. He championed the role of the municipal corporation in its efforts, and in 1687 issued a Royal Charter to start the first ever corporation outside London. In which city did King James II launch the second oldest civic body in the world?3 Born on February 6, 1726, Patrick Russell was a Scottish surgeon and zoologist who is considered the ‘Father of Indian Ophiology’. In 1785, he became the Naturalist to the East India Company in Madras. During his time he identified a snake known to the locals as ‘katuka retula poda’, which Europeans didn’t know about but was only second to the cobra in lethality. Eventually this, which is one of the Big Four snakes in India, was named after him. What species of snake, also known as ‘kannadi viriyan’ in Tamil, is this?4 Born on February 6, 1834, Edwin Klebs was a German-Swiss pioneering microbiologist. He discovered a bacterium, then called ‘Klebs-Loeffler Bacterium’, which caused an infectious disease that has been described since 5 BC. Thanks to Klebs’ work, we eventually had a vaccine for the disease that is often given along with those for pertussis and tetanus as a formula known as ‘DTP’. Klebs discovered the reason for which disease?5 Born on February 6, 1913, Mary Leakey was an English-Kenyan archaeologist and anthropologist who discovered 15 new species of animal and named a new genus. She also excavated many fossils of ape-like creatures that were ancestors of humans. In 1976, she and her team discovered a trail of footprints fossilised in volcanic ash, which were more than 3.75 million years old. Known as the ‘Laetoli hominim footprints’ at that time, these were the earliest example of what important human feature?6 On February 6, 1935, this now very popular board game went on sale for the first time. The game was designed based on ‘The Landlord’s Game’ created by Lizzie Magie to demonstrate how an economy that rewards wealth creation is better than one where a business is the only supplier of a product or service. The game as we now know has numerous variations and is a rare game in which a player can go to jail. What game is this that many families have played together?7 On February 6 this singer-songwriter attained global fame for his characteristic style of music and song writing. Skillfully fusing elements of reggae, ska and rock, his songs, which also had a sense of spirituality, spread the world over and popularised the concept of ‘Rastafarianism’. Who was this iconic musician whose pictures can be seen on t-shirts of youth till this day?8 On February 6, 1952, Elizabeth II was in a tree house in Kenya when she learnt about the death of her father George VI, following which she became Queen of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. On this day, one of her guests, a famous hunter, wrote in the visitor’s book — ‘For the first time in the history of the world, a young girl climbed into a tree one day a Princess and after having what she described as her most thrilling experience she climbed down from the tree next day a Queen’. Who was this guest who rose to fame hunting man-eating tigers in Uttar Pradesh?9 On February 6, 1959, electrical engineer Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments filed the first patent for an invention that he had come up with. Since he was a new employee, he couldn’t take a summer vacation so he spent the time working on a computer related problem called ‘tyranny of numbers’. His solution earned him a Nobel Prize in Physics and led to a revolution in the world of electronics, as now circuits could be smaller and inexpensive. What now ubiquitous entity did he invent?10 On February 6, 1988, this sporting legend made one of his signature moves from the free throw line during an NBA slam dunk contest. His move, which saw him flying through the air, earned him a title, and a logo which has since become one of the most recognisable and valuable symbols in sports. Known as ‘Jumpman’, this logo is based on which legendary sportsperson?A molecular biologist from Madurai, our quizmaster enjoys trivia and music, and is working on a rock ballad called ‘Coffee is a Drink, Kaapi is an Emotion’. @bertyashley

 Shunned by many as symbols of death and ghoulish desolation, vultures could not really hope to be the centrepiece of a conservation campaign. Even deep mythological links in Hinduism, as in the
Ramayana
, have not staved off their precipitous decline over the decades in India.
Their importance to ecosystems has, however, been recognised and spurred a major conservation effort, with research scientists, forest departments, conservation agencies, non-governmental organisations and bird lovers joining forces. One NGO behind the effort to save vultures based in Tamil Nadu, Arulagam, focuses on changing public attitudes towards these ‘sanitary workers’. It is this story of revival, of an often unloved group of birds found in the western mountains, gorges and valleys and plains, that conservationist S. Bharathidasan narrates in his bilingual English-Tamil book,
In Search of Vultures
.
Overcoming barriersThere is no clear picture of how many vultures remain. In fact, the State of Indian Birds 2020 report gives the current trend for the birds as a ‘strong decline’ for the Egyptian, red-headed, white-rumped and Indian vultures, and ‘moderate decline’ for the cinereous and bearded vultures. The slender-billed vulture with a restricted range is listed as ‘data deficient’ while for Himalayan and Griffon vultures current trends are ‘uncertain’. This makes conservation work of the kind pursued by Bharathidasan and Arulagam critically important.The author, who prefers to call vultures ‘Paaru Kazhukukal’ (rock-living raptors), rather than ‘Pinanthinni Kazhukukal’ (carrion-eating) has struggled to overcome two major barriers to conservation pursued by his NGO, mainly in a 100 km radius of the Nilgiris Biosphere Reserve. The first was to change the public perception of vultures as loathsome carrion feeders. And, it had to overcome resistance from farmers and the pharmaceutical industry to the ban on veterinary painkillers. Drugs such as Diclofenac and Ketoprofen, when given to cattle, render their carcasses toxic for the birds.With no charismatic values, and not much appreciation of either their environmental role or unique digestive system as scavengers, vultures do need a fresh introduction. Bharathidasan brings them to life with this basic guide, featuring bright full plate images of the species in India and those frequently seen in Tamil Nadu (the white-rumped, long-billed, Egyptian and red-headed vultures are commonly sighted and the cinereous, Himalayan Griffon and Eurasian Griffon vultures only sporadically in the State). The other species sighted in the country are slender-billed and bearded vultures. The story gets particularly absorbing when the exploration harks back to ancient Tamil literature and Hindu mythology. Bharathidasan recounts the references to vultures in Sangam literature, including the
Akananuru, Purananuru, Pathitrupathu, Ainkurunuru
and
Natrinai
. The interested reader looking wider will find, for instance, that the
Purananuru
mentions vultures, crows, owls and pokuval birds gathering in burial grounds at night, amidst wandering ghosts.
The contemporary sobering reality, retold here, is that two vultures that regularly came to feed at the well-known Thirukkazhukunram temple in Chengalpattu district stopped appearing after 1994, causing considerable lament among — and losses to — the local residents.It is a long road ahead for Arulagam, Bharathidasan and many organisations such as the Bombay Natural History Society, Malabar Natural History Society and Saving Asia’s Vultures from Extinction (SAVE) working to conserve these unique birds.Diclofenac has been banned for veterinary use for years, but human-use formulations continue to pose a challenge. Other drugs such as Ketoprofen (banned in Tamil Nadu and later by Bangladesh, according to the conservationist), Aceclofenac, Nimesulide, Flunixin, Carprofen and Analgin can kill too.

"K.R. Meera’s magic-realism-suffused novella,
Qabar
, can seem like a conundrum at first, making you wonder about its true essence. But then you realise that the work defies specificity and categorisation. It is many things at many levels — at once a fierce feminist tract and a magical love story, at once a hypnotic chiaroscuro of history, memory and the occult, and a political comment on religion, identity, law and justice.
 Translated from the Malayalam by Nisha Susan,
Qabar
is told as the first-person narrative of Bhavana Sachidanandan, an additional district judge and single mother to a boy with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The story weaves in and out of the sober reality of Bhavana’s existence and the realm of the occult and the supernatural, to which her mind gravitates.
Her real world is taken up with the cases she presides over in court, an ex-husband whose memory still rankles, her child’s condition, his tantrums that must be borne, and his heartbreaks that must be soothed.There was a time when Bhavana adored the man she was married to, even though he was a bully who needed to feel superior to her, forcing her to make sure that she never outshone him in any way. She parted ways with him eventually, because, as she euphemistically explains to her child, he lacked “empathy.”Abusive relationshipsHowever, it is not just Bhavana who threw off the suffocating burden of an abusive and unequal marital relationship. Her mother had done the same. Soon after Bhavana’s wedding, she had left her husband for a “room of her own”.“When I was your age, I thought family means heaven,” her mother tells her. “After a while, I understood that this too is a workplace. A twenty-four-hour job. No leave, no promotion… At work you might get a good service entry. At home, nothing you have ever done appears in the accounts. Only, everything else you are supposed to do.”This is the searing realisation of generation after generation of women — that marriage can be brutally exploitative, that it is an institution where the demands on a woman’s love and service are never-ending and never enough. Bhavana is part of this reality, as was her mother before her, and even though both have broken the cage and flown out, perhaps that reality defines them still. But then magic enters Bhavana’s life, and touched by its mesmeric, iridescent spell, her carefully held-together emotional equilibrium, her beliefs and prejudices and her understanding of what’s right and possible, crack and shatter.A petitioner named Kaakkasseri Khayaluddin Thangal appears in her court, seeking to stop the construction on a piece of land which, he claims, contains the grave or
qabar
of an ancestor. The moment their eyes meet, Bhavana faints. She learns later that he is a sorcerer, a mind-reader, a djinn-worshipper, and the maker of all manner of magic.
Mundane to magicalPerhaps she is in thrall to him right from the outset, for soon her mind starts leaping towards the magical and the otherworldly. She becomes almost obsessed with the strange lore of her own family — the ancestor with supernatural powers who drew his strength from two girls whose feet never touched the ground. But even magic and miracles are no proof against patriarchal savagery. The other men in the family were intent on destroying these magical beings, so they nailed and stifled the two demi-goddesses and killed the shaman who cherished them. At some point in the narrative, Thangal the magician and the mind-reader becomes the one for Bhavana. To her, he spells empathy and understanding and
savoir faire
. Perhaps therein lies his real power, the real source of his ability to turn the mundane into the magical, the banal into the sublime.
 Thangal represents a lot more, though. The
qabar
that he is fighting to protect bears echoes of the Babri Masjid that was pulled down, and his lived experience of being a Muslim in India points to religious bigotry and the ruthless divide between Hindus and Muslims that has been kept smouldering for centuries in this country.
Qabar
throbs with a multi-dimensional intensity and a multiplicity of themes that may seem somewhat directionless at times. But its appeal is really that of poetry — splendorous with half-glimpsed truths. This book
is a journey unbound by the usual markers and the usual answers — it’s where the real and the illusory come together and take us along in their everlasting tide.

"Same man? The cover of Amar Chitra Katha’s Chanakya: The Kingmaker. Special arrangement
 The
Arthashastra
is an atypical text. For one, it is unlike the religious texts of that period in being quite precise and definite. One’s eyes might glaze over after reading some of the
smritis
, even the
Upanishads,
but the
Arthashastra
can easily hold the reader’s attention. Yet (this is also why it is atypical), it is not widely read or taught.
 Written in prose 1,500 or 2,000 years ago — nobody is quite sure — the text is a set of books that are part constitution, part penal code, part taxation manual, part landscape manual, among other things. One bit on battle and positional warfare is like Sun Tzu’s
The Art of War
.
The work is credited to Kautilya, who may or may not be Chanakya, the Brahmin who is supposed to have orchestrated the defeat of the Nanda king in the Gangetic belt.Comprehensive text The
Arthashastra
was known through quotes in other historical works but the full text was unavailable till it was discovered on leaves by a librarian, R. Shamasastry, in the first decade of the 20th century. Shamasastry also translated it, followed by Professor R.P. Kangle a few years later.
I have the Penguin edition, edited and arranged by the former diplomat, L.N. Rangarajan. He has organised the work in the following way: the state and its constituent elements; the king; the nature of a well-organised state; the treasury, its sources of revenue accounts, and functions of audit; the civil service and its regulations; law, justice and punishment; covert operations; foreign policy; defence and war.If it seems comprehensive, it is. And, of course, it is also shot through with considerations of caste, so much so that one has to hold one’s nose while reading much of it. Many are familiar with only one part of the
Arthashastra
, which is, strangely enough, its smallest part: the section on foreign policy. Kautilya is thought to have said that an immediate neighbour is to be seen by the state/ king as an enemy while the neighbour’s neighbour is to be seen as a friend. A more interesting, and I daresay more relevant, section in the same book is the chapter on the weak king.
The weak king Kautilya examines the options of one who is being threatened at the borders by a larger and more powerful neighbour. The text first quotes two previous writers on strategy (as is common through the
Arthashastra
, what has been said before is examined and critiqued). One is Bharadwaj, who counsels the weak king to surrender immediately; the other is Vishalakha, who advocates fighting to martyrdom. Kautilya advises neither course. Instead, he says that the king ought to submit to (“seek the protection of”) and ally with a more powerful ruler, who is stronger than the opponent. The idea of joining hands with the enemy’s enemy makes sense. Kautilya says one ought to be servile to the protector (“as a courtier to a king”), which may surprise those who think of kingship in terms of honour.
If an alliance is not possible, then surrender is the best option, says Kautilya. After surrender, care should be taken to give up assets that are not particularly useful or to use slow-acting poison on useful assets like elephants and horses. This is the sort of practical advice that the
Arthashastra
is filled with and what makes it readable. But the fact remains that Kautilya (like Sun Tzu) is not theoretically sound on many issues, which might be one of the reasons why he hasn’t found the recognition he deserves.

Though we invest remarkable amounts of time, put in hard work, possess proficient qualities and skills, the fear about someone or something puts a pause to the revelation of our talent and potential and makes it hard to reach the road of success.However, fear becomes essential sometimes to safeguard oneself from desperate circumstances. But when its proportion exceeds, it is vital to learn and practise the techniques to handle and overcome fear. First, try figuring out the nature of fear and pen down its causes. By now, you have reached half-way because you have gained clarity over the issue and started to look out for befitting measures to confront the fright.Whenever you feel panicky, feel free to express your fear to a reliable person who can help you look at the problem from a different perspective and extend support and guidance. If you fear about something which falls within your control, steps can be taken to resolve the problem. For instance, students constantly fear about their performance in exams. Such stress in the long run may result in severe physical and psychological issues such as sleeplessness, anxiety and the inability to digest petty failures and rejections. This is the point when parents must instil confidence and motivate their children.Note that you are losing out on peace and happiness when fearing about things that does not fall under your control. Whatever has to happen will happen and so move ahead with an attitude of acceptance. One can extract optimum advantage by preparing with courage to battle the haunting factor as it will build self-confidence that paves space for personal development and supplies the strength to tackle complications. A few years ago, I was quite hesitant to speak in English. But now, I have developed myself to write and speak in English fluently without errors. Treat fear as an opportunity for growth and never allow it to conquer you.Feed yourself with positive affirmations (I’m strong, I can do it) every day with belief which will yield you productive results as proven by research. Visualising your goals is a key to overcome fear, preparing the brain to procure the sources required to accomplish one’s desires.indhuja.nagarajan@gmail.co",0,0,0,1

A recent study says memories retain remarkable fidelity even as we age. Encouraged by this assurance, I recall my early student days, across the gulf of almost seven decades. We had a monotonous and busy schedule during the academic year. The summer vacation extending over a couple of months, therefore, held out hopes of long, carefree holidays.Invariably, the last in the series of annual examinations would be the geography paper which was abracadabra to most of us. Almost everybody would step out of the examination hall about half an hour before time. Boys would discuss in groups their plans for vacation, even as the burly supervisor on rounds shouted in a stentorian voice, “Please leave the hall.”There was no question of attending special classes or summer coaching institutes. While the affluent went to summer resorts in Ooty or Kodaikanal, others hostellers go back to their hometowns to rejoin their parents. A few would assist their parents in family enterprises. The rest would spend the holidays at home playing cricket on the street or visiting relatives and family friends.One summer, after my repeated entreaties, my parents finally allowed me to spend a month in our village near Thanjavur where my grandparents lived. It was a great moment when the express train with me in a window seat steamed out of the Tambaram station. I was in cloud nine as if I was leaving on a round-the-world trip.As the train picked up speed, I could watch with delight the telegraph posts and the railway track dance and fly past me. I was excited at the sight of verdant fields, gardens, flowing channels and dry water courses. Huts entangled by pumpkin plants gleamed out impressively from among clusters of swaying coconut trees. For one who had been only in the city, the sight of the countryside was indeed delightful.My daily routine underwent a radical change in the village. My grandfather, a stickler for discipline, insisted that I rise with the lark and accompany him to the river for a bath. He did not seem to notice my sleepiness and protests. As we returned after the bath in the gentle morning breeze, I felt rejuvenated. Grandpa taught me to recite prayers and hymns, which are still green in my memory.I had to switch over to millet porridge flavoured with cinnamon and cardamom for breakfast, missing my usual steaming coffee. A walk along the paddy fields with my grandfather regaling me with interesting stories now punctuate by anecdotes glorifying rural life and cultivators. He made me understand that farming was the fabric of village community. I developed an attachment for the polite and helpful villagers.It was with a heavy heart that I returned. Back in school, my friends told me that I looked fresh. Rural air and millet porridge had asserted their virtues.ramaraon2014@gmail",0,0,0,1

They want to make it as difficult as possible for the defenders to find the winning defence if there is one.In today’s deal, from a team competition some years ago, declarer did not want to lose the lead to East. East would lead a low club and declarer did not want to guess the club position.

 While publications on heritage textiles and costumes abound, it is much rarer to find writings which connect the dots with colonial history. This volume bridges the gap. Tracking evolving changes in how people used different textiles and clothes, influenced by social and professional mores during colonial rule, Jasvinder Kaur’s
Influences of the British Raj on the Attire and Textiles of Punjab
seamlessly links past with present.
It underlines how material culture was not experienced in isolation but as an entwining of the personal with the larger national narrative. With a focus on Punjab the author’s in-depth research together with oral histories, photographs, letters, newspaper clippings, objects, topical advertisements unfold a history of textiles influenced by the zeitgeistof that period to bring about lasting changes which are still visible.New lifestyleIn the introduction, Kaur writes that from the mid-18thcentury right up to 1947, western influence pervaded all aspects of Indian society and culture. “Indians were exposed to a new language, new types of food, new lifestyles, such as sitting on chairs, eating at dining tables... Inevitably, the influence crept into their ways of dressing, and was visible not only in the adoption of Western wear by Indians, but also in the westernisation of Indian clothes.” If men took a fancy, she says, to wearing not only a fully western outfit, but also combinations of European and Indian apparel, women changed the style in which they tied the sari, and began to wear fancy blouses — as Satyajit Ray showcased in his Tagore adaptation,
Ghare Baire
(‘Home and the World’) — and petticoats.
There were different codes of dressing for different functions — a uniform for the armed forces, formal attire for the court or durbar, office wear, sport wear. From the wearing of trousers, waistcoats and overcoats to a hybrid mix of clothing that combined traditional wear with the contemporary, these shifting patterns of clothing and accessories responded to the times. Pyjamas began to be teamed up with coats, under the coats men often wore kurtas.In the world of women, the changes wrought were more subtle and the author has delved into these hidden histories. With the introduction of dining and ‘living rooms’ and ‘formal’ entertainment,embroidered items went beyond the Phulkari to include bed-sheets, tablecloths, cushion covers, napkins, sofa-back covers and other items that were now embroidered in the European style with patterns taken from imported women’s magazines. These magazines played a part in impacting design — needlework and knitting magazines, pattern guidebooks on sewing with pull-out iron-on transfers were easily accessible in Punjab. Specialised shops that traced and transferred designs and patterns for embroidery and sewing complemented the craze for the new and modern. While women’s clothing largely remained the same, there were changes in material where ‘vilayati’ or foreign cloth was often in use, albeit before the swadeshi movement. Other changes were equally subtle like the addition of cuffs, collars and sleeves similar to men’s fashions that were added on to women’s kurtas along with the donning of embroidered ‘vaskat’ or waistcoats. Children wore frocks with smocking and the fashionable used cosmetics and curled their hair.The strength of the publication also lies in its exploration of the many ways in which the past has shaped our present material culture of dress and attire.This marvellous publication must set the way for others to follow as there are many more such hidden histories from across India still waiting to be written.The reviewer is founder-trustee of the Craft Revival Trust and editor ofAsia InCH EncyclopaediaandGlobal InCH Journalof ICH.Influences of the British Raj on the Attire and Textiles of PunjabRupa

"harles Darwin can rest easy: an “abominable mystery” he complained of in 1879 might be solved soon. The latest discovery of a fossilised flower bud dating back to the Jurassic period proves that there were flowering plants or angiosperms in the Jurassic period.

It suggested that there were no angiosperms in the Jurassic period and then they suddenly appeared and diversified at an amazing rate from the mid-Cretaceous period onward. Darwin, who strongly believed that nature does not make a leap, was intrigued and disturbed by this. The new fossil proves that angiosperms were very much there in the Jurassic period although they might have been uncommon and found only in specific geographical clusters.

"ChangemakerSanjay Sahni with MGNREGA workers at Mahant Maniyari village of Muzaffarpur district, Bihar.Ranjeet Kumar
| Photo Credit: RANJEET KUMAR
M.R. Sharan’s splendid book,
Last Among Equals , brought tears to my eyes on more than one occasion. The scene is a public meeting at “Narega Chowk” in Ratnauli village, Muzaffarpur district of Bihar. Activists of Bihar Manrega Watch (BMW) are helping resolve grievances. An old woman speaks. She has worked a full 100 days on MGNREGA a few years ago only to never get paid for it. When she brings her grievance to the meeting, even the activists are surprised at the lack of documentation on her part and chastise her for it. At the end of the meeting, the author observes her, in a corner of the tea-shop, “clinging to a pole and staring at the steadily pounding rain, soundlessly mouthing the words” to a protest song.This and many other moments fill the book and demonstrate the deep empathy of the author. Following economist Albert Hirschmann, Sharan aims to convey “a feeling for what he witnessed as village life and politics in Bihar.” He succeeds brilliantly, bringing the reader a powerful cocktail of RCTs (randomised controlled trials) and Srilal Shukla’s Raag Darbari. The writing is witty and poignant, the scholarship is deep, and the style is eminently readable. Sharan also has a gift for simile. One of the book’s characters is described as speaking “in staccato bursts, like an Aaron Sorkin character on a Zoom call with intermittent connection.”Sanjay Sahni’s storyThe real-life, amazing story of Sanjay Sahni, a Bihari migrant in Delhi, an electrician-turned-MGNREGA activity-turned aspiring MLA, is the glue that holds the book together. The story starts with Sanjay hearing the word “Narega” in his village of Ratnauli. Ratnauli is where most of the book’s action takes place. Back home in Janakpuri (in Delhi), it is 2011, and Sanjay is becoming more and more curious about what goes on in his neighbourhood internet cafe. One day he musters up the courage to walk in and sit at a computer. Wanting to do something “important” and “worthy of the computer” he types the words “bihar narega” in the search engine. With a series of breathless clicks on the official MGNREGA website, he travels to Muzaffarpur, then Kurhani (his block) and reaches his village. One last click and he is virtually meeting people he knows. ‘It was like I was sitting in Delhi, but also in my village,’ says Sanjay to the author.Sanjay senses that he has struck upon vital information. He spends cash he can ill-afford to print out pages and pages of MGNREGA wage payment records. His subsequent efforts, carrying those pages to Ratnauli, finding evidence for corruption and building a peoples’ movement to improve MGNREGA functioning in his village occupy a large part of the book. The story culminates in his inspiring campaign for MLA in the 2020 Bihar elections.From ground zeroOriginally a Karnataka native, Sharan has been a close observer and participant in the peoples’ movement around MGNREGA as well as other issues in rural Bihar for over 10 years. He has carried out large-scale surveys, visited government officials at the village, block, district and State level, and spoken to thousands of workers in this time. Grounding his narrative in data as well as stories (and funny anecdotes), he introduces the reader to the workings of “last mile democracy,” i.e. panchayat-level politics, how welfare programmes work (or do not work), why it matters that programme funds are sent directly to the ward instead of through the panchayat, and above all how salient local caste relations remain to explain outcomes. Along the way, we learn of the fascinating history of caste-based reservations for Mukhiyas in Bihar, from its origin as an ordinance in the 1980s during the Bindeshwari Dubey government to its passage as a law 18 years later.The story of Mandesar Ram, another recurring character in the book and a Dalit ward member in Ratnauli, illustrates, quite literally, the problems with last-mile delivery. Ram has a bank account opened for his ward, receives government funds and pays a contractor to lay water pipes and taps in the households of his ward. He also installs a pump to draw groundwater. The final step is to get an electricity connection to power the pump. But Bhumihar landlords in the neighbouring ward refuse to let electricity lines pass via their (unused) lands. Sharan describes the heartbreaking story in plain terms, choosing to let the bald facts do the talking. All Ram has to show for his efforts are “electric poles without wires and taps without running water.” In a nutshell, as Sharan notes, the story illustrates both, how far Dalits have come in two generations (from being forced to stand up and remove chappals at the sight of upper-caste landlords to being elected ward members in the panchayat) and how much more needs to be done.Overall, the book deals with the functioning of four large programmes over the past decade — MGNREGA, the nal-jal yojana (provisioning of piped water), the nali-gali yojana (for drains and lanes), and the Bihar Right to Public Grievance Redressal Act (BPGRA). The second and the third schemes are part of Nitish Kumar’s Saat Nishchay (Seven Resolves). The last one is worth noting since Bihar is the first state in the country to make grievance redressal a right. But the lessons go far beyond these welfare programmes and also beyond Ratnauli and Bihar. Sharan has given the English-reading (and therefore largely urban) audience a closely observed, scholarly, and empathetic account of the struggle to make constitutional promises a reality in rural India.The reviewer teaches Economics at Azim Premji University.Last Among Equals: Power, Caste and Politics in Bihar’s VillagesWestland Books",0,0,0,1
" green mango found lying on the ground made its way to the dining table. Kumar Gandharva cut it open with a sharp knife, slicing it into long pieces. With an anticipative ‘aahaa’ and ‘waah’, he added salt and red chilli powder to the slices, and then served them to everyone at the table.“His habit of appreciating even the littlest of things was truly extraordinary,” recalls his daughter, singer Kalapini Komkali, in the essay, ‘Bhanukul’s Kitchen Raga,’ in the latest edition of the online journal,
oneating.in .That one of the greatest exponents of Hindustani music could be so appreciative of a raw mango doesn’t surprise me. For food is often in harmony with music. An essay titled ‘Why Hindustani Musicians are Good Cooks: Analogies between Music and Food in North India’, written by musician Adrian McNeil in the journal,
Asian Music (1993-1994), explains the link.Joy and creativityMcNeil says that in both culinary and melodic recipes, it is essential to use the “correct ingredients” in “appropriate proportions” and to follow an “established methodology” for combining them. “In both instances, the end result is expressed through the aesthetic marker known as
ras, ” he writes.No surprise then that Ali Akbar Khan was greatly admired not just for the way his sarod sang, but also for how his biryani tasted. In
Zakir Hussain: A Life in Music (by Zakir Hussain and Nasreen Munni Kabir), tabla exponent Zakir Hussain recalls his short stay with Khan in the Bay Area of the U.S. “It was just he and I and his cookbook! He was a good cook and made delicious biryani, daal and chicken curry.”Khan’s former brother-in-law, Ravi Shankar, had the able support of his trusted cook from India, Vasudevan Nair. In
Indian Sun: The Life and Music of Ravi Shankar , Oliver Craske recalls a recording of one of Shankar’s albums at George Harrison’s home in Henley-on-Thames. “At breaks there was sumptuous Indian food prepared by Ravi’s chef Vasudevan Nair, and the music reflects a relaxed atmosphere of joy and creativity.”Many of the musicians didn’t just like to eat but enjoyed feeding others too. In
The Sixth String of Vilayat Khan , biographer Namita Devidayal relates how, when Hariprasad Chaurasia was performing in the U.S., Vilayat Khan sent a message to the flautist, inviting him to dinner with the tantalising lure of some partridge curry he’d cooked. Chaurasia feigned illness, cut the concert short, and landed up at Khan’s house in time for dinner.Hearty belchesThe stories whet the appetite for food and music. Komkali’s essay, for instance, is full of flavours. “To this day, nothing has been able to compete with Aai’s
aamti , which is a special sweet and sour dal, or her
ghadichi poli , which, in other words, is a paratha made without ghee or oil, a specialty of Maharashtrian cuisine,” she writes. “Baba ate slowly, relishing every bite as he said ‘waah’…‘waah’ praising the smallest of detail that he might have liked about the food.”Some of the best descriptions of food and music are to be found in Sheila Dhar’s
Raga’n Josh . She writes about Bade Ghulam Ali Khan’s open dismay at being served a meatless meal at a vegetarian home during a visit to Delhi. “The maestro scowled at the unfamiliar food and lowered the large and rather shapeless thumb of his right hand into each bowl in turn, hoping against hope that it would encounter a piece of meat on a bone,” she writes.But before a concert, the singer needed something more nourishing. So he prepared a chicken curry — with six broiler chickens, khoya, almonds, ghee and all kinds of spices — over a charcoal fire. “Three or four hearty belches announced the end of this phase of proceedings and we finally set off for the site of the concert,” Dhar writes.What can one say to that but ‘aahaa’ and ‘waah’?Ali Akbar Khan was greatly admired not just for the way his sarod sang, but also for how his biryani tast",0,0,0,1
"Real-life storiesThe conversations between the two reporters offer powerful insights.

Hamza Syed gave up a career in medicine to become a journalist because he believed that stories — and the ability to tell them — could make a difference. As a British citizen of Pakistani origin, he had seen the insidious rise of an “Islamophobic logic” in a U.K. moving towards Brexit, revealing itself in throwaway remarks by politicians about women in hijab and facile associations of faith with religious fundamentalism. The story that sparked his journalistic impulse had to do with an unsigned letter that pointed to a supposedly sinister plot by Islamic extremists to take over public schools in Birmingham. “Operation Trojan Horse”, as the alleged plot came to be known, was never proven, and the identity of the letter writer was never found, but it set in motion a series of events that sparked a government probe, upended teaching careers, sent a high-performing school in a Muslim neighbourhood into a downslide, and left a cloud of suspicion over an entire community.Eight episodesHamza Syed teamed up with journalist Brian Reed from Serial Productions (now owned by
The New York Times ) to investigate the truth behind the letter — who wrote it and why, and, more importantly, why it was allowed to cause the damage it did. Their investigation, conducted over several years, unfolds across the eight episodes of
The Trojan Horse Affair , a podcast that is as much about story as it is about the dynamics of story making.The duo’s reporting progresses in fits and starts, through the Birmingham city council to the department of education and the country home of a pair of retired teachers and other venues where Syed and Reed meet with the many people connected with the events following the appearance of the mysterious letter.Syed’s location as a Muslim and a person of colour in British society, are powerful drivers that frame his journalism, and, as someone who had “carved out a sweet spot, a brown person who white people were at ease around... I thought I could get access to white rooms of power and focus them on our brown issues.” But his growing frustration and disenchantment is clear as he deals with recalcitrant sources and an opaque bureaucracy.Sounding alien“I know it’s common for us immigrants to get twisted up in our split-cultured existence,” he says, after a dead-end conversation with a Birmingham councillor who, despite being generally sympathetic to the Muslim community, “still managed to make people like me sound alien and dangerous in some way”.The conversations between the two reporters offer powerful insights into how personal location and experience shape the ways in which a story is seen, pursued, and told. The structure of the series is reminiscent of the typical journalistic whodunit, real-life stories recreated in films like
Spotlight and
All the President’s Men . The podcast allows us to walk with Reed and Syed as they file requests for information and doggedly follow the most tenuous leads, alternating between hope and despair.In Episode 2, we watch them set up their “HQ” in Syed’s parents’ bedroom, whiteboards and stickies on the wall as they apply their forensic skills to the letter of interest. Reed recounts the moment: “Hamza sat in his parent’s bed and read the letter aloud, as I paced around, scribbling names and schools on the white boards, circling some, crossing off others.”It’s the details like this that draw us into the journey that Syed and Reed are on, and keep us there for a binge-worthy eight episodes.
The Trojan Horse Affair is a podcast that is particularly resonant in these times, reminding us of how easily localised, professional rivalries can become coopted by powerful forces into narratives that serve political ends — in this case, feeding into Islamophobia.The story that sparked his journalistic impulse had todo with an unsigned letterthat pointed to a supposedly sinister plot by Islamic extremists to take over public schools in Birmingham

One morning, my four-year-old daughter asked me if I were a girl. It was not a silly question. It prompted me to think deeply.I was sweeping the front yard of our house that day. Usually, my wife or mother does this, while I read the newspaper. It is not that I don’t know sweeping. I just choose not to do it. If I remember right, the last time I swept the front yard was when I was a child playfully helping my grandmother. It was her daily routine. My mother started doing it and now my wife does it.My wife fell sick and I was forced to share the workload with my ageing mother. There I started sweeping, and the little one got up in the morning seeing me on the job instead of her grandma or mother.“Are you a girl,” she asked and started smiling.I have not seen my father or grandfather sweeping the front yard. We have all grown up with gender discrimination ingrained in our selves. Just think of the gender that comes to your mind when you imagine a driver, pilot, doctor, minister, judge, president, teacher, nurse, receptionist and maid. Our minds are conditioned to think like that.When the Malayalam movie
The Great Indian Kitchen became a talking point, I asked a few married men and women about the film. Surprisingly, almost all from Kerala, across gender, did not find anything special in the movie. They could not see gender discrimination. Few women even felt the leading lady was a bit odd, not doing what every other woman in Kerala does in her ordinary life. The world outside Kerala was celebrating the movie as path-breaking Indian cinema. The movie was not a Malayalam movie anymore, but an Indian movie.The other day, my colleague came back to office after recovering from COVID-19. His wife, three small children and mother all fell sick and recovered. He had tiring days taking care of the family, a task his wife managed every day on top of her work. He appreciated his wife now!A woman’s life is not easy in Kerala or India. I am reminded of a scene in the Malayalam movie
Salt ’n’ Pepper . The boy asks the girl why she is holding her books covering her chest, and starts wondering why his mother did not tell him to hold books like that! Women live their daily life fully aware of their gender and its limitations every moment. Men like me are so privileged that we do not even think of our gender.Can we not wash our own plates? Just be mindful of women in all our deeds! All of us can make a woman’s life better.cerinpathrose@gmail.com

1 Born on February 20, 1967, Kurt Donald Cobain was a genre-defining singer and songwriter whose angst-fuelled songs influenced an entire generation of musicians. The band he started with two others was active only for seven years. He released three albums but became the leading force in rock. Their punk aesthetic songs about social alienation and ‘come as you are’ attitude led to the rise of a new genre called ‘Grunge’ till the singer’s death in 1994. What was the name of this band which comes from a central tenet of Buddhism?2 On February 20, 1959, a 16-year-old rock-and-roll guitarist played his first gig in the Temple De Hirsch synagogue basement in Seattle. During the interval he was fired from the band due to ‘wild’ playing and stealing the spotlight. By the time of his death in 1970, he became one of the most influential guitarists of all time. Known for playing a right-handed guitar upside down, playing with his teeth, and even setting his guitar on fire, who was this iconic guitarist who gave you an experience you would never forget?3 Born on February 28, 1942, Brian Jones was a highly talented musician who played guitar, keyboards, sitar and various instruments. He founded a band, giving it its now globally famous name and started writing songs with his friend Keith. Although he founded the band in 1969 he was fired from it as he couldn’t give them satisfaction. A few days later he was found dead in a swimming pool. Which band did he name after a song about an old saying of not settling in one place?4 Born on December 8, 1943, James Douglas Morrison was a poet and singer whose amazing stage presence and songwriting cemented his status as one of the greatest front men in music. His songs could break through due to its intuitiveness and deep meaning. When he passed away in 1971, people couldn’t believe he was gone. Which band was this which, when the music’s over, you feel like the gates of perception have been opened for you?5 Born in 1911, Robert Johnson was a travelling performer who used to perform on street corners. He disappeared for a brief period of time but returned with an extraordinary skill of playing but soon passed away under mysterious circumstances in 1938. It was such a drastic change in playing that people thought he had sold his soul to the devil in return for his skills. In what genre of music born from the work songs of African slaves did Johnson excel at?6 Born on January 19, 1943, Janis Joplin was a singer with an electric stage presence giving every show a piece of her heart.

"he first story in this collection, ‘The Hard Drive’, is initially misleading, for it seems to be a prelude. Then one reads the other stories and realises that they all stand independent of one another; they are narrated by different voices, at times playing with autobiographical elements. But in some ways, ‘The Hard Drive’ is still a prelude: it introduces the reader to the thought process informing this collection.‘The Hard Drive’ is narrated by a person who claims to be always right, and who is mnemonically recovering stories from files of fiction and photos that he lost after his hard drive collapsed. It later turns out that he was instrumental in that collapse, but what the story indicates is a certain relationship to reality: “My job now is to describe this person, to reconstruct him and, to begin, what I can tell you is that all his friends, his family and his acquaintances hate the fact that he’s almost always right.”This last line of the story is both indicative and purposefully misleading: both this story and many others that follow suggest the plasticity of stories and the irony in any claim to recover reality.Play on fiction and realityThe stories revolve around different objects: a coconut-scraper, a diaper, a mask, a leash, etc. However, they are not focussed solely on the object. ‘The Coconut-Scraper,’ for instance, is an account narrated to a conceptual artist of a coconut-scraper, said to be the representation of a martyred proselytiser. It turns out, towards the end, that the account of the martyr is fabricated, giving the story — and this is a common feature of some other stories too — a rather anecdotal turn that, nevertheless, is redeemed by its play on fiction and reality: “Does it matter if it is true?” The answer that this story suggests, despite its ironical ending, is ‘no.’ I have serious differences with this answer, but it is the preferred answer of our generations and age, particularly those who insist, like the narrator of ‘The Hard Drive,’ on being always right about the truth.Though the stories are staggered over a few decades (and scattered around many countries), some of them also engage with the pandemic. ‘The Mask’, narrated by an adolescent and set in the early months of the pandemic in Italy, ends in aporia — one does not know if the narrator is infected or not. This seems disappointing until one notices that it is appropriate to the times and the virus. However, another pandemic story, ‘The Hand Sanitizer’, is far more anecdotal or incidental.A certain slightnessThis leaning towards anecdotal stories is both the strength and the weakness of this collection. It confers a lightness of touch on the better stories, usefully underplaying the serious or tragic undertones. But sometimes it can lead to a slightness, especially when the many different voices narrating the tales have a similar tone and pitch. This exists despite the obvious fluency of the narration, or maybe because of it, and the occasional flashes of description that linger in memory: “The days stumbled over each other like people at a crossroad looking at their phones.”I preferred those stories, meandering though they tended to be, which tried to suggest something more elusive. For instance, ‘The Portrait’, obviously a play on Oscar Wilde’s famous novella, works through an initially rambling narration about a young man’s obsession with an older woman, and his relationships with her son and daughter, to finally suggest the mysteries of time and personality. The best stories are those that, like ‘The VHS Tape’, combine an unexpected anecdote connected to the ‘object’ with an open ending which suggests more than it says.The objects seldom appear in their thingness. The focus is rather on their ‘history’, or, in effect, on a story that envelops the object or connects to it. At the same time, the story is not necessarily bound to the object: one can imagine many other stories enveloping the same object. In all this, the collection seems to exemplify the post-modern celebration of storytelling, with some stories embracing it and some uneasy about it.But despite the unease, this celebration has survived the wave of story-making politicians across the world. It will be interesting to see if it survives the more homicidal stories of the pandemic too; for instance, the ones that exhort people not to take the vaccine.The reviewer is an Indian novelist and academic who teaches in Denmark.A Historyof ObjectsHarperCollins IndiaThe objects seldom appear in their thingness.

"wo classics, T.S. Eliot’s
The Waste Land and James Joyce’s
Ulysses , published in the same year, 1922, turned out to be epochal in English literary culture. The former, speaking beyond the shores of Europe, created a poetic revolution across the globe, including in India, where it shaped the modern poetic sensibility. Joyce’s
Ulysses, however, which earned more admirers than readers, didn’t have such an impact on our novelists. Nevertheless, it has continued to be on the list of classics in our curricula. Its intimidating narrative structure, which demands readers’ patience and cultural competence, makes it a difficult read.Ulysses , which turned 100 this year, has come a long way through trial and triumph. Even English-reading countries, accustomed to the social realism of Charles Dickens, George Eliot or Thomas Hardy, found a different joy in Joycean aesthetics. As someone who has struggled to read the novel, I like to compare my experience of reading it with listening to Hindustani classical music in Dharwad — an intoxicating encounter.The idea of developing a narrative around the protagonist Leopold Bloom was there in Joyce’s mind when he was writing a short story collection,
Dubliners (1914). He started working on
Ulysses in 1914, and it began to be serialised in the American literary magazine,
The Little Review, in
1918.
The Little Review, founded by Margaret Anderson with the help of Ezra Pound, published
Ulysses in
instalments
until its copies were seized on the grounds of obscenity.
Ulysses remained officially banned in England until the late 1930s. It was first published in book form in Paris on February 2, 1922. However, before its publication became legal, several copies had been smuggled and pirated into Europe and America.The first gentlemanEnglish painter and activist Frank Budgen records the genesis of
Ulysses in
James Joyce and the Making of ‘Ulysses’ and Other Writings (1972). He says that in Ulysses, Joyce wanted to create a fully evolved character, more rounded than Faust and Hamlet, and he found that resonance in Homer’s Odysseus, whom he called “the first gentleman in Europe.”Like Odysseus, Leopold Bloom wanders, but in the streets of Dublin, for no more than 18 hours. He avoids going home because his wife Molly, unlike the eternally faithful Penelope, is having an affair.
Ulysses is a modern-day
Odyssey , with every episode corresponding to an adventure of Odysseus. Yoking the epic to the modern era, it explores modernity. As Eliot put it, “In using myth in manipulating a continuous parallel between contemporaneity and antiquity, Mr. Joyce is pursuing a method which others must pursue after him… It is simply a way of controlling, ordering, of giving a shape and significance to the immense panorama of futility and anarchy which is contemporary history.”Mythical statusUlysses
has now attained mythical status. People dress up like the characters and read the book aloud; like pilgrims, they visit the places in Dublin mentioned in the novel; Bloomsday is observed in Ireland on June 16 every year to mark the day of Bloom’s peregrination. There is a lesson in this for contemporary writers — to write is to experiment, there is no revolution without breaking the mould of the given.Half of the novel’s success lies in the very fact that it is a reworking of a well-known work, but what Joyce did with the European classic is fascinating. He pushed the boundaries of novel writing with innumerable experiments — in the handling of narrative time, style (each chapter has a different style) and the inventive use of language.
Ulysses makes use of plays, bizarre stories, myths, musical forms — all coming together in the main characters’ stream of consciousness to create polyphony.The meat of the matter is not in the plotting but in the descriptions of the setting and characters. Therefore, this novel’s meaning is its style. This is precisely the source of both its difficulty and pleasure. Deliberately created puzzles and intertextual allusions challenge readers, but it is exciting. The reader has to stop and think, refer back, look for meanings, thus becoming a co-author. And that’s the fun of it.Ulyssesled to further literary experiments. For instance, Jacques Derrida’s 60-page essay, ‘Ulysses Gramophone’ weaves together fragments of
Ulysses and his own composition. Derrida examines the complexity and richness of
Ulysses by exploring the word “yes” in the novel.Joyce once said that he wished to write a novel that critics would continue to comment on for 100 years. Well, he has certainly succeeded.The writer teaches English Literature at Tumkur University, Karnataka.The reader has to stop and think, refer back, look for meanings, thus becoming a co-author.

At the start of 2022, it is already clear that the year will be filled withforeignpolicy challenges for India.For the third consecutive year, the coronavirus pandemic has meant the cancellation of bilateral and multilateral visits, beginning with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s planned trip to the UAE and those of five Central Asian leaders due to travel to Delhi to be the chief guests at the Republic Day parade.Indian diplomats have their hands full drafting ripostes to statements of concern issued by other countries on India’s domestic troubles: from Jammu & Kashmir to the hijab ban, non-renewal of foreign NGO licences and the handling of protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.The troubles from Afghanistan and Pakistan continue on the western horizon, and on the eastern front, China’s refusal to budge on positions it has occupied since April 2020 along the Line of Actual Control led to another unfruitful round of talks in January, with no assurances that the People’s Liberation Army would ever return to status quo ante. And while the U.S.-India relationship is filled with promise, and a QuadSummit is due to take place in Tokyo in the next few months,much hinges on President Biden’s determination on giving India a sanctions waiver under the CAATSA law on the S-400 systems procured from Russia, which becomes a more awkward task given the present tensions over Ukraine — the list continues.Up-to-date analysisAmid complex diplomatic interpolations comes a compendium of essays authored by more than 30 of India’s most senior diplomats.India’sForeignPolicy in the Post-COVID Times: Through the Eyes of Indian Diplomats , edited by former ambassador Surendra Kumar, presents an up-to-date analysis of the present situation, and the challenges faced in 30 different areas, each according to their expertise: from overviews of India’s challenges on security and several economic issues (by Shyam Saran, Shivshankar Menon and Rahul Chhabra), to essays on COVID and climate change, the specifics of India’s relations with the U.S., Russia, China, the EU, West Asia, Central Asia, Africa, Japan, Brazil and Mexico, primers on India’s ‘Act East’, Indo-Pacific, diaspora and soft power policies (the last of which, Mr. Kumar notes, predate Joseph Nye’s thesis).Each essay is a handy masterclass. Of particular note is the editor’s decision to include separate chapters on each of India’s neighbours, written by envoys to those countries, including T.C.A. Raghavan on Pakistan, Jayant Prasad on Afghanistan, K.C. Singh on Iran, Deb Mukherji on Bangladesh, Ranjit Rae on Nepal, Ranjan Mathai on Sri Lanka and V.P. Haran on Bhutan. Insights on the current Ukraine crisis and the difficulty of prising the Russia-China relationship loose (P.S. Raghavan), the larger objective behind Chinese aggression in times of COVID (Neelam Sabharwal), the importance of focusing on UN Security Council reform for India (Asoke Kumar Mukerji) make for a thoughtful reading on current events. The real charm of the essays is the freedom with which skilled practitioners have shared their analysis without hesitations about protocol or political pressure.Historical perspectivesBarring a few exceptions, where authors have expressed unblushing praise of the government they served under, the essays contain both examples of success and critiques of failure of various policies of the past 75 years, and how they pertain to the world post-COVID. Above all, the essays portray events by grounding them in a historical perspective. If a common thread is to be discerned it is the vision of an India who stands independently in a world of competing poles, is an exemplar of pluralistic, inclusive and humanistic thought not one that rejects its past, but grows from it, with aforeignpolicy that is a force multiplier for the nation’s ambitions for itself. Written simply, and shorn of complex “diplomatese”, the book should be read as a “message from the elders”, one which both students of Indianforeignpolicy, and its practitioners in South Block would be wise to study.India’s Foreign Policy in the Post-COVID World: Through the Eyes of Indian DiplomatsWisdom Tree

Dear Agony Akka,I am an 18-year-old girl. I have a lot of friends who pressurise me to open an account for myself in Instagram. I am not really interested in social media and all those things. I find it boring. I don’t even use my Facebook account regularly. Then, one day, they all just ganged up on me, humiliated me, and left me in tears. Is it wrong to survive without a social media account?—Really Embittered and LowDear REAL,It wasastonishing to get your email. I did not realise that there are 18-year-olds existing in the world today who can survive without Instagram or social media. It was a bit like that scene from popular Hollywood film
The Martian where the NASA guys are looking at Mars through satellite imagery and they find Matt Damon sitting there, alive and eating potatoes.It is quite a shock, you know. My first thought was, oh my god we must send a rocket to her planet and rescue her.Notice how I use the word ‘rescue’. The first thought one gets when one receives an e-mail from an 18-year-old without Insta account is that of extreme deprivation. What does she eat? Is she feeling cold? Can we use a drone to air-drop a smartphone to her so that she can send us pictures of her current condition? How about calling the Army to shimmy down the building and deliver essential supplies like broadband cable etc.Then one calms down and breathes easy. Because you realise here is one 18-year-old who is sending lucid e-mail and is clearly alive with fully functioning brain. Now, my thought was, oh my god can I send rocket and join her in this offline nirvana.Simultaneously, many other thoughts were running through my head. How did she escape? Does she use Kevlar or Kryptonite monkey cap on head to prevent the entry of the overwhelming, overpowering desire to take pictures of herself in every possible variation of activity and share it with the world?As you must have noticed in cafes, streets, bus-stops. During face-washing, nail-polishing, beard-trimming. Coffee, baby, abs, other body parts. Everything is photographed and uploaded. I have no idea why this gen is recording itself in such detail for posterity. I cannot see any kind of posterity or extra-terrestrial life that might be remotely interested in how Gupta-ji eats parathas. Forget posterity, even presenterity is not interested. But does this faze them? Not one bit. They stream on relentlessly like lemmings headed over a cliff.That is when I realised that scientists might be interested in this letter writer. They are doing important research work to find out what makes the homo sapien tick. What has this two-legged creature done in the Anthropocene era that has brought us so close to imitating what happened to the dinosaurs in the Cretaceous era.But researchers are finding it very hard to get intact brains for study. Large portions of the human brains they are receiving in the labs these days have turned to mush. Like what happens to Parle G biscuit when you dip it for too long into hot tea. Useless for study purpose.But you, dear REAL, might still have an intact brain. And that will one day come in handy for Science. Please be sure to leave a signed will assigning it for research. Meanwhile, continue life in that rarefied atmosphere where you can still eat Maggi without the world watching.I can’t.— AAagony.akka@gmail.com",0,0,0,1

Salim Ali is synonymous with bird study in India. In fact, he popularised the science of ornithology —
TheBook of Indian Birds
 and
Birds of Kerala are landmark contributions. The massive 10-volume
TheHandbook of the Birds of India and Pakistan that he brought out with S. Dillon Ripley contains a wealth of information and still is a reference guide to birders. InW
ords for Birds, Tara Gandhi has collected and edited Salim Ali’s radio broadcasts (1941-1985).An assortment of 35 delightful talks, the volume brings forth the turns of phrases and the subtle humour of the astute bird watcher, delightfully echoing his famous autobiography,
The Fall of a Sparrow.Winter visitorsBombay of the 1940s is way different from what it is now. In one of his earliest talks he notes: “Now we are getting into the season when you must keep your eyes and ears open for incoming winter visitors. Arrivals have already commenced, early as it is. I noticed a Whimbrel and a couple of Sandpipers the other day…; and many more are doubtless on their way. The majority of migrants, however, will not be amongst us before October. But the Wagtails and Pipits should be on our lawns and maidans before long, and you must look out for them. Mark the dates of their arrival and departure year after year and you will be astonished to find how regular and punctual they are with their time table.” There’s a tone of intimacy in his talks, as he takes off from the maidans of Bombay to the Himalayan ranges of Sikkim, the valleys of Assam to the Western Ghats of Kerala.The editor has done a good job of dividing the talks into five sections — Watching Birds, Seasons for Birds, Learning about Birds, Birds at Risk, and Nature in India, which project the broad range of the naturalist’s eye. His concern for habitat preservation and protection of fauna on the brink of extinction is amply brought out in these brief talks. “What is now required is the understanding of the fact [that] human ecology is an integral part of nature conservation, and all who take a total view of life on earth must realise that man’s future cannot be considered separately from that other life…”The talks revolve round intimate observations of bird behaviour, nesting and migrations, the science of bird watching, specific comments on human interaction with birds and mammals, the need for a serious step towards conservation of land and habitat, and are interspersed with personal reminiscences. To the outsider, the birdwatcher often appears to be an odd creature, and Ali understands why people may get puzzled: “Their first glimpse of me very often has, it is true, been of a shabby khaki-clad of the garage mechanic type, wandering leisurely and rather aimlessly about the countryside and surreptitiously peeping into bushes, and holes in tree trunks and earth banks….”
He was sometimes taken for “a dangerous criminal.” Now, as a rule, he says, ornithologists are “mild and harmless individuals.”As early as 1957, Salim Ali called attention to five vanishing species of Indian birds: Pink Headed Duck, Mountain Quail, Jerdon’s Courser, the Great Indian Bustard and White Winged Wood Duck — a warning we should have taken serious note of.In his references to the delights of listening to bird calls and songs, watching them flit through leaf and grass, the reader can sense the relentless aesthete, and similarly, when he highlights the need to conserve biodiversity and protect the natural habitat, we sense the urgency and call to positive action of an ardent ecologist.The reviewer is Professor and former Chair, Department of English, Pondicherry University.Words for Birds: Collected Radio BroadcastsBlack Kite/ Hachette India

As a left-hander, I often used to ask myself whether the trait is a bane or a blessing. Unable to find out a clear answer, I became reconciled to the fact that being a lefty is both.Many do not approve of lighting a lamp or offering money with the left hand, as it is considered taboo and unpropitious. Once a flower vendor abused me for paying her early in the morning with my left hand. I have often been subjected to such scurrilous attacks whenever I used my left hand by natural instinct.On the positive side, however, it is said that lefties have a better memory and are able to remember the exact dates of events and sometimes even the exact words that were spoken.For those who may not know, August 13 is celebrated as International Left-Handers Day, when many lefty-friendly products are launched and awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of being a left-hander are spread among the public. Also, activities are held for right-handers to try out products made for lefties.Interestingly, 14% of U.S. Presidents have been left-handers, including Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan. Not to forget, many famous musicians, like Paul McCartney and Beethoven and writers Mark Twain and Lewis Carroll, have been left-handers.At oddsIt is said that 10% of the world’s population is left-handed. Therefore, in a world where most people are right-handed, lefties often face the difficulty of performing day-to-day tasks with appliances that have been designed to suit the convenience of right-handers. Naturally therefore, left-handers are more likely to be injured while handling gadgets.It is found that left-hand batters in international cricket have prodigious talent. Is there some quality inherent in southpaws that allow them to progress to the highest level of cricket? Or do the laws of the game favour them?Research since the 1980s has shown that our preference for being left- or right-handed is probably determined in the womb as early as the eighth week of pregnancy.From week 13 in the womb, the foetus tends to suck either the right or left thumb, the research adds.siva19kumar@gmai",0,0,0,1

He said the primary focus of the government was on giving a second dose of the vaccine to make people fully vaccinated. “Administering the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine to all adult population and ensuring that not only India but the entire world gets vaccinated is the priority of the government for now,” he said. A day earlier, Dr. Samiran Panda, Head of ICMR’s Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases Division said scientific evidence does not support booster doses. “Right now, the scientific evidence from within the country does not underline the need for a booster dose. Public health considerations are on the priority now,” he told the news agency
ANI.Precaution dose In mid-December 2021, Dr Jayaprakash Muliyil, member of NTAGI told
The Outlook:
“There is no need for a booster dose as the memory cells will produce the specific antibody once the virus comes in contact with a vaccinated or a naturally recovered person.”
Yet, a “precaution dose” was approved by the government on December 25, 2021. No new studies have come in the public domain to support an additional dose since Dr. Bhargava said on November 22 that no scientific evidence was available to support a booster shot.Early data from South Africa and the U.K. indicate that the Omicron variant does not cause severe disease or death in fully vaccinated people. But there is a time lag between infection and hospitalisation. The protection offered by vaccines available here against the variant in older people and other vulnerable populations is not known.Omicron threat?Whether the decision to approve the precaution dose was based on the emergence of the Omicron variant but in the absence of vaccine effectiveness data is not clear. There was no explanation on why the government revised its earlier stand and decided to provide an additional dose before increasing second dose coverage either. “In fact, the Omicron variant makes a strong case to increase primary vaccination coverage considering the preliminary data from South Africa and the U.K.,” says immunologist Dr. Satyajit Rath formerly with the National Institute of Immunology, Delhi. Across age groups, nearly 90% have received the first dose but only 64% are fully vaccinated. And 21.5% of those older than 60 years are yet to be fully vaccinated as on December 31, 2021.There has been just one study each for Covishield and Covaxin to understand vaccine effectiveness (before Omicron emerged) despite the vaccines being granted an emergency use approval 12 months ago. The study on Covaxin did not even look at the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing severe disease and death.Incidentally, the immunocompromised people have not been included. “A third dose or additional dose for immunocompromised is something on which experts have consensus. [Unlike many countries] in India, where third shot is recommended for sub-group of population only, a separate policy on third shot for immunocompromised is urgently needed,” says Dr. Chandrakant Lahariya, physician-epidemiologist and public policy and health systems specialist.On December 30 last year, Dr. Bhargava while not providing any scientific reason or evidence for deciding on approving a booster shot, did point out to studies that had found evidence of protection offered by natural infection lasting up to nine months. This was to tell why the government has decided to provide the precaution dose nine months after the second dose.Hybrid immunityThe emphasis was on hybrid immunity (immunity produced by natural infection followed by vaccination) being superior to immunity conferred by infection and full vaccination in infection-naïve people, which was known many months ago, to support the decision to administer the precaution dose nine months after the second dose. Dr. Bhargava cited the 67% seroprevalence in the last sero survey to drive home the point that many people who have been vaccinated would be possessing hybrid immunity. The sero surveys are not truly representative of infection spread in the community, says Dr. Rath. And if hybrid immunity in India is high, why provide an additional dose at all, he asks.“We know that the longer the gap, the better the boosting effect. Since India has made the decision to administer precaution shots, this is the longest gap which could have been considered,” says Dr. Lahariya.Limited useOne of the studies cited by Dr. Bhargava and carried out by researchers from CSIR’s Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata looked at cellular immunity among vaccinated and naturally infected people. The researchers found that T cell immunity from natural infection lasted as long as 10 months. But they did not measure the duration of protection offered by T cell immunity in fully vaccinated people who have not been previously infected. “They [T cell immunity studies] are not robustly quantitative. All they can say is yes, there is some T cell response, which is not surprising and is of limited use,” says Dr. Rath.Choice of vaccineAll the other Indian studies cited by Dr. Bhargava which looked at the duration of protection had measured only the humoral immunity and neutralising antibodies. But with breakthrough infections being far more common with the Omicron variant than the Delta variant, these studies have little relevance in making policy decisions.The Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya made an assurance on December 3 last year that the government will go by scientific advice to decide on booster doses. But on December 25 when the government approved the additional dose and even now there is no clarity on whether the booster dose will be with the same vaccine that an individual has got for the first two doses or a different one.“Scientific evidence is that the preferred booster will be a vaccine developed using a different platform,” says Dr. Lahariya. “I am of the opinion that in the case of Covishield, the booster should be protein-based vaccines — Covovax (data of its boosting effect is already available) and then Corbevax. The homologous booster would be the best approach for Covaxin, till we have evidence on heterologous boosting for Covaxin.”But Covovax and Corbevax were granted emergency use approval only on December 28, three days after the government announced a booster dose for select groups. “If the government was waiting for scientific evidence on booster doses, why did it hurry before deciding on whether the booster should be a homologous [same] or heterologous [different] one,” asks a senior scientist who did not want to be named.No trials for booster Incidentally, there is no scientific evidence from clinical trials in India on the efficacy of Covishield or Covaxin as booster shots. Permission to conduct the first clinical study in India to understand the performance of a vaccine as a booster was granted only on December 29; Bio E was given permission to conduct the trial using Corbevax as a booster dose. While the Subject Expert Committee denied permission on December 10 to Serum Institute to administer Covishield as booster doses till it submits clinical trial data, Covaxin will be used as a booster dose despite no clinical trial for efficacy being conducted. According to
News18,
Bharat Biotech had sought permission to conduct a clinical trial to test the efficacy of Covaxin as a booster dose only after the Prime Minister’s announcement on December 25.

"ime was when forests covered most of the landmasses on the earth. With rising human populations, development and need for connectivity, many of these forests are now just either a big patch bordered by trenches, fences and human settlements, or scattered unconnected pockets.People visiting forests feel great about being in nature. They capture some memories and photographs, and write blogs about how splendid nature is. What they forget in the due course is the compromise some of the long-ranging animals must have gone through. One such animal that needs a large roaming space and seasonal connectivity to different forests are elephants. Their movements are not just motivated for foraging, but for searching for mates, suitable habitats across seasons and resources.The boundary marked by us for forests as protected often goes unnoticed by the oblivious wanderers of the wild. Let us take elephants as an example. Amid the escalating interactions between elephants and humans lie our failed attempts of facilitating the movement of these giant animals through one of their abodes to another. From an animal perspective, the trench, wall, or fences can just be a set of hurdles that they attempt to cross to reach their destiny. For a taxon of proven complex cognition, everything around them could just be a conundrum that they seek or ‘learn’ to solve.Learning elephantsElephants have been observed using such ‘learned’ skills to either cleverly cross electric fences using their non-conducting tusks or if no tusks, destroying the entire fence by hurling uprooted trees on the wire or pushing down the cemented poles to disconnect the wire. These are some testimonies suggesting how elephants perhaps may be learning to solve the conundrum based on their previous noxious experiences.In 2015, during the fieldwork in the southern forests of India, some field signs were collected of elephants crossing a trench (of depth around 2.5 to 3 metres, assuming with the rusty skill of estimation), supported by an almost 80-degree tilted retention wall on one side, protecting the proximal village from these behemoth ‘trespassers’. It would baffle any onlooker’s mind, how a group of elephants crossed such a hurdle. Upon cautiously inspecting footprints on the wall – which debossed all the way up and disappeared among the bushes and the trampled grasses on the forest floor, seeking another life, confirmed that elephants walked this trail. Amidst these footprints on the wall, there were some with smaller circumferences suggesting the group also had calves!Stunned villagersHow have they climbed down and then up? The village stood as stunned as most of the observers were.Furthermore, scrutiny of the piles of fresh dung at the base of the trench indicated that the presence of millet seeds as remnants excreted by elephants. As per the gut-retention time (the time needed for food swallowed by elephants to pass through their digestive tracts till excretion) of elephants, it was evident that they must have foraged on agricultural crops 30 to 48 hours ago. On their way up, they might have emptied their bowels!Altered habitatsThis is just one opportunistic instance among many anecdotes and videos that we stumble over in social media, where we see elephants ingeniously crossing the electric fences, iron rails and even trenches. Most of these videos leave us with dropped jaw, hinting to us how elephants could alter their behaviours in response to the altered habitats!Crossing the border is not as painless as it is narrated here. It comes with the challenge of risking their lives. We hear of elephants encountering humans adversely, being electrocuted while crossing the electric fence, dying while crossing the iron rails, falling and dying in the trenches. Each hurdle they cross may psychologically influence their internal states, either preparing them with skills and anticipatory responses to learn to cross or leave them hurt.Our limited understanding of the purpose and patterns of elephants’ movements blur our desperate trials of fostering coexistence. Elephants’ successful attempts of crossing the boundary just muddle up many who are not just trying to understand the highly intelligent being, but also trying to seek a sustainable solution to retard the accelerating adverse interactions between them and us. Connecting habitats with the corridor devoid of human presence and activities may reduce elephants’ interactions with humans, lower their stress and favour their purpose of movement. Talking of conservation of animals’ with complex cognitive ability, the need is, thus, the connectivity, perhaps not just the border!(The author is from Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, U.S., and a visiting scientist at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru.)

"The efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines depends in a complex way on the strength of the prime doses and the time interval between the prime doses and the booster shots. A computer simulation study carried out by researchers at Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru (IISc) attempts to understand how this works. The research is published in the journal
Frontiers in Immunology.Immune responseEarlier observations from the trials of the Oxford–Astra Zeneca vaccine have shown that immune response of people given prime doses and booster doses depended on the strength of the primer and the interval between the prime and boosters in a counter-intuitive way. The efficacy in preventing symptomatic infection was 63.1% when a standard dose containing 5 X 1010 virus particles was administered for both prime and booster. On the other hand, if a low dose prime, consisting of 2.2 X 1010 virus particles, was administered, there was a higher efficacy observed of 80.7%.Similarly, when the interval between the prime and booster was less than six weeks, an efficacy of 55.1% was seen, which rose to 81.3% at 12 weeks or greater, when standard doses were used for both prime and booster.Studies are being conducted to study the effect of dose strength and intervals between prime and booster for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines too.Understanding how this operates will be useful in determining the delivery of vaccines in circumstances where there is shortage of vaccines. It will also help in optimising the effect of vaccines. ""Why low dose prime or delayed boost improves COVID-19 vaccine efficacies is not well understood, and this hinders optimal vaccine usage which is critical given limited supplies. Our study presents a plausible explanation,” says Narendra Dixit from IISc’s Department of Chemical Engineering who led the work that has been published in
Frontiers in Immunology.With the above observations in mind, researchers from Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, and University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia, made a computer simulation to study how the creation and proliferation of B cells happens in the germinal centres of the body’s immune system.Germinal centreThe role of cellular immunity is not fully understood, but studies suggest that the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines is proportional to the number of neutralising antibodies they elicit. Germinal centres are the places where the cells that produce antibodies are selected for. These are temporary structures that form in lymphoid organs, for periods ranging from a few weeks to several months.In the germinal centres, B cells are selected based on the ability of their receptors to bind to the antigen presented as immune complexes. In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, the antigen in question would be the part of the spike protein.Simulated modelThe researchers simulated a model of the germinal centre reaction in the computer and studied the effect of low prime dose and long interval between prime and booster shots given equal prime doses.The hypotheses they tested were the following: In the case of a smaller prime dose, in the germinal centre, there are fewer available antigens (spike protein attached to immune complexes) for the B cell receptors to bind to, therefore only those B cells that show a higher efficiency in reaching and binding to the antigen would survive and grow. Those B cells that fail to bind would die out. Therefore, this results in the selection of the B cells with higher propensity for antigen-binding. Once a booster is given, these B cells which have a higher affinity for the antigen are multiplied, and therefore the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing symptomatic illness would also be higher.In the case of equal prime shots and delayed booster what would happen, the researchers hypothesised, was that during the longer interval, because antigen levels go down with time, only those B Cells that had a higher affinity for antigen would survive and the others would have died out and therefore, when the booster was given, it would multiply such B cells having higher affinity.In their simulations, the researchers saw that this did indeed take place.Further studies needed“Our prediction is based on comprehensive computer simulations of the process underlying antibody production in our body in response to vaccination. Future studies may validate the explanation using experiments, paving the way for rational optimisation of vaccine deployment strategies,"" says Prof. Dixit.If the predictions are verified by experiments, they can guide the protocols of giving out vaccine shots and booster doses in a more efficient manner, which is crucial now.

"re there other sources of ancient DNA besides bone and teeth?Scientists, for the first time, recovered DNA from cement on hairs taken from mummified remains that date back 1,500–2,000 years. This is possible because skin cells from the scalp become encased in the cement produced by female lice as they attach eggs, known as nits, to the hair. Analysis of this newly-recovered ancient DNA – which was of better quality than that recovered through other methods – has revealed clues about pre-Columbian human migration patterns within South America
(Molecular Biology and Evolution).
This method could allow many more unique samples to be studied from human remains where bone and tooth samples are unavailable.
 Dr. Alejandra Perotti at the University of Reading, who led the research, said in a release: “Like the fictional story of mosquitoes encased in amber in the film
Jurassic Park,
carrying the DNA of the dinosaur host, we have shown that our genetic information can be preserved by the sticky substance produced by headlice on our hair.”
Until now, ancient DNA has preferably been extracted from dense bone from the skull or from inside teeth. However, skull and teeth remains are not always available. Recovering DNA from the cement delivered by lice is therefore a solution to the problem, especially as nits are commonly found on the hair and clothes of well-preserved and mummified humans.

"n December 28 last year, Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya tweeted saying that in further strengthening the fight against COVID-19, the Indian drug regulator has granted emergency use approval for the antiviral drug molnupiravir. He also mentioned that molnupiravir will be manufactured by 13 generic drug manufacturers in India.“Considering the emergency and unmet medical need in COVID-19, the SEC on December 27 recommended for grant of permission to manufacture and market molnupiravir for restricted use under emergency situation in the country for treatment of adult patients with COVID-19,” the drug regulator said in a statement.A week later, on January 5, at a press conference, the Director-General of ICMR Dr. Balram Bhargava said molnupiravir has major safety concerns and therefore was not included in the national protocol for treatment of coronavirus.“We have to remember that this drug has major safety concerns. It can cause teratogenicity, mutagenicity... cartilage damage and can also be damaging to muscles. Contraception will have to be done for three months for male and female if this drug is given because the child born could [have problems] due to teratogenic influence… We have concerns about the drug and its use during lactation, in children, soft-tissue injuries, reproductive age group,” he said.Public health problem“After the EUA, Indian generics are now aggressively launching the drug, and it is likely to be prescribed widely to patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with mild/moderate disease in the private sector. This may be problematic from a public health point of view, because of concerns regarding the inherent capacity of molnupiravir to cause viral mutations and its risk to induce more viral mutants,” says Ms. Leena Menghaney, South Asia Head of Médecins Sans Frontières’s Access Campaign.“The drug is already available and pharmaceutical companies are aggressively marketing it. In all likelihood, the drug is abused already,” says Dr. Lancelot Pinto, Consultant Respirologist at P.D. Hinduja National Hospital and Medical Research Centre, Mumbai.“Drug companies are aggressively marketing the drug with blatant lies and tall, unsubstantiated claims [such as] reduction of post-COVID-19 anxiety, depression and fatigue but without a word on potential risks,” says Dr. Shriprakash Kalantri, Professor of Medicine at Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Sevagram, Maharashtra. “Why do the two highest scientific bodies — the drug regulator and ICMR — take such conflicting positions. This sends a confusing signal to the public and physicians.”Not the first timeThis is not the first time that the national COVID-19 task force has refused to include drugs/vaccines granted an EUA by the regulator.On August 20, 2021 Zydus Cadila’s COVID-19 vaccine ZyCoV-D was granted an emergency use approval by the Indian regulator. The vaccine was approved for use in adults and children 12 years and above. However, in a letter dated December 28 last year, Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said Covaxin will be the only option for vaccination of children 15-18 years that was set to begin on January 3. He also said Covaxin is the “only vaccine with EUL [emergency use listing] for the age group 15-18”. The same message was conveyed by the guidelines released by the health ministry.But speaking to CNN News18 on December 27, Dr. R.S. Sharma, CEO of the National Health Authority and Chairperson of the Empowered Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (Co-WIN) said both Zydus’s vaccine (ZyCoV-D) and Covaxin will be available for vaccination and children will have an option to choose between the two vaccines depending on availability.For reasons not known, the health ministry has not only declined to use Zydus vaccine in adolescents but has not even recognised the emergency use approval granted to ZyCoV-D by saying Covaxin is the only vaccine that has an EUL. Incidentally, emergency use listing or EUL is a term used by the WHO and not by Indian authorities or the drug regulator.In the second case, itolizumab, a monoclonal antibody originally developed by Biocon and sold under the brand name Alzumab to treat psoriasis, was granted an EUA on July 11, 2020 to treat patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 disease. The subject expert committee greenlighted the drug the previous day despite the very small size of the study and inconclusive data. But three days after approval, Dr. Bhargava said trials have not yet demonstrated that the drug can reduce mortality. On July 27, 2020, it became clear that the drug will not be included in the national treatment protocol.Absence of dataStrangely, ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma therapy were included by ICMR in the recommended treatment guidelines even in the absence of data. Hydroxychloroquine was approved in end-March 2020 primarily for ICMR to carry out studies.Convalescent plasma was dropped from the guidelines only in mid-May last year. Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine were dropped from the revised clinical guidance for management of adult COVID-19 patients only on September 24 last year. WHO had on March 31, 2021 said there is inconclusive evidence of benefit in the case of ivermectin.“Even after a year of COVID-19, the ICMR guidelines in May 2021 advised ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine which were well known to have been useless for COVID-19 treatment,” Mr. Murali Neelakantan, Principal Lawyer at Amicus, Mumbai says in an email. “On the other hand, the drug regulator had approved favipiravir and itolizumab to treat COVID-19 but they don’t find place in the ICMR protocol, even though hundreds of crores of rupees worth of these two drugs were being consumed in India. It says something about the Indian drug regulator that favipiravir and itolizumab are not being prescribed for COVID-19 anywhere else in the world.”Remdesivir and favipiravir were approved by the Indian regulator and included in the treatment guidelines even when supporting data were not available or were inconclusive.In fact, on November 20, 2020, WHO recommended against the use of remdesivir in hospitalised patients, regardless of disease severity. Yet, the revised clinical guidelines of September last year have retained remdesivir for use in specific circumstances.

"ndia is facing an epidemic wave of Omicron disease presenting mostly with sore throat, nasal discharge – without cough or high fever. Pneumonia is uncommon. Blood oxygen level remains normal.Some senior citizens and those with diseases or therapies that weaken the immune system do get severe disease requiring hospitalisation. Altogether, Omicron disease is a milder version of COVID-19 with Wuhan-D614G or Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants.Mutational changesAll previous variants had few mutational changes of the spike protein, Omicron has many more, particularly in the ‘receptor-binding domain’ (RBD), the ligand that binds to host cell receptor, ACE-2. While earlier variants have 8-9 mutations on the S1 portion, Omicron has 32-37 in different studies. On RBD, Omicron has 15 mutations, while others have only 1 to 3. This many mutations have resulted in several alterations in the virus-host cell interactions. For example, the viral load in saliva is high, allowing high sensitivity in RT-PCR of saliva samples. Much virus is broadcast into air even without cough. Obviously, the need for face masks cannot be overemphasised, to block virus shedding (by the infected) and to prevent inhaling air-borne virus (by others).Coronaviruses have two cell entry processes – the major one by fusion of virus envelope with the cell membrane and the minor one by fusion with the endosomes within the cytoplasm. Virus multiplication is far more efficient with major than minor process. All previous variants use the major cell entry process.Omicron uses the second process, as elucidated in laboratory experiments. After receptor-binding the receptor–virus complex is ‘swallowed up’ by the cell through ‘endocytosis’ without affecting the cell membrane. The endocytotic vesicle (invagination of cell membrane) then fuses with subcellular organelle called endosome, a normal process. The virus coat now fuses with endosome membrane, releasing the virus genome into the cytoplasm.In the first process with cell-surface fusion, all adjacent cells also fuse with the infected cell and form a ‘syncytium’ – giant cell with multiple nuclei. Syncytia are closely associated with disease severity, particularly with lung pathology. In laboratory experiments with Omicron, syncytium formation does not occur. This change presumably leads to less virus production in the body, less invasion of organs and tissues, lower severity and duration of symptoms, decreased need for hospitalisation and low case-fatality ratio – altogether a watered down 2021 version of COVID 2019. Omicron resembles influenza virus infection that remains mostly confined to upper respiratory tract.Immunity evasionOmicron has a propensity for immunity evasion. Virus neutralising antibodies induced by infection by all earlier variants or any of the available vaccines are far less effective against Omicron disease. Most monoclonal antibodies that were effective to treat COVID-19 are no longer effective to treat Omicron disease. However, the world over, high degree of protection against severe disease requiring hospitalisation by enhanced antibody levels achieved by a booster dose, is observed. Experience from the U.K. is instructive. Vaccine effectiveness against Omicron disease requiring hospitalisation was 72% during 2-24 weeks after second dose, but only 52% after 25 or more weeks – significantly increasing to 88% two weeks after a booster dose.Even when antibody fitness to the virus (affinity) is low, the sheer magnitude of antibody level enables antibody-binding to more viruses, thus enhancing functional effectiveness as shown in the U.K. Had India gone on a massive public education on the importance of two doses of vaccine to mitigate the impact of Omicron wave, and also on the value of booster doses to increase protection, we could have had a relatively normal life in India during January–February of 2022 – many scientific meetings and other events scheduled for these months could have proceeded unhindered, instead of getting postponed.These many changes – genetic, fundamental cell–virus interactions, pathology, virulence, disease characteristics, immunity evasion – set Omicron apart from all other variants. To emphasise its greater deviation than other variants, imagine the term ‘deviant’.The term deviant indicates the high degree and abruptness (non-continuum) of change – in virology, the terms used to represent substantial genetic differences are: lineage, sub-type or serotype – depending on the degree of deviation. We expect the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses will address this question without delay, as we have already alerted the WHO and the International Society of Infectious Diseases.If we consider Omicron disease sufficiently different from Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), perhaps it deserves the name COVID-21. If it is considered a deviant with antigenic shift, rather than drift, as is the case in all variants, the current upsurge of disease overcoming high population immunity can be considered a new pandemic, not simply a wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.Influenza pandemicAnalogy with Influenza Type A virus epidemiology is interesting. The 1957 pandemic due to a subtype H2N2 emerged when the H1N1 of 1918 pandemic was still circulating as endemic/seasonal. H2N2 with antigenic shift not only spread globally, but it also displaced H1N1 from circulation – why? Immunity induced by H2N2 was sufficient to prevent H1N1 circulation. In 1968, the next pandemic started with H3N2 subtype; it displaced H2N2, presumably due to cross-immunity. The 2009 pandemic was with a new variant of H1N1, with borrowed genes from swine influenza, and named H1N1pdm09 to distinguish it from the earlier H1N1. Antigenic cross-reactivity with H3N2 was not strong – hence both H3N2 and H1N1pdm09 are in co-circulation globally as endemic/seasonal.While Delta variant overshadowed all earlier variants that are nowadays infrequently found anywhere, we anticipate that Omicron with antigenic shift and compromised cross-reactivity may not displace Delta. Omicron being more transmissible than Delta, we speculate: (1) In 2022, both Delta and Omicron might co-circulate, and (2) we may need vaccines against all variants of SARS-CoV-2 as well as against Omicron and its future variants, if any.(T Jacob John and M S Seshadri are former (retired) Professors of Virology and Endocrinology, respectively, at Christian Medical College, Vellore and Dhanya Dharmapalan is a pediatric infectious diseases specialist in Navi Mumbai.)

Neurons, or nerve cells, in the brain connect by means of junctions known as synapses through which they transmit signals. Recent work by researchers at the National Centre of Biological Sciences, Bengaluru, has thrown light on what stimulates these synapses to form.There are two types of synapses – chemical and electrical. In chemical synapses, there is a space of about 20 nanometres between two neurons, and the way they communicate is this: One neuron converts electrical signal into chemical signals and this chemical is released into the synaptic space and the receiving neuron converts the chemical signal back into an electrical signal.As far as the electrical synapse goes, this is not the way it operates. In these synapses, the two neurons have a physical connection and the conversion of electrical to chemical need not occur, and they communicate directly. Electrical synapses are like a physical wire, communication is faster but they are also fewer in number.Neuron handshakeIt was shown that electrical synapses are formed before chemical synapses, they are like a blueprint in which neurons make a handshake. This results in the making of chemical synapses. Research on organisms such as leeches showed that if you remove electrical synapses, the chemical synapses do not form. However, the mechanism of how it happens in higher organisms such as vertebrates was not known.Researchers from TIFR-National Centre of Biological Sciences, Bengaluru, have chosen Zebrafish as a model organism to study this process. Zebrafish are transparent and neuron development in larval zebrafish can be observed from day to day by injecting a dye or by engineering the fish to express fluorescent proteins.Purkinje neuronsThe group observed that knocking out a particular protein known as the gap junction delta 2b (gjd2b) in the cerebellum of zebrafish affected levels of an enzyme CaMKII. Levels of CaMKII were seen to increase in the Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum. These neurons and the cerebellum itself control co-ordination of movements in the organism. In humans for example, excess abuse of alcohol leads to damage of these cells, which results in lack of co-ordination in movement.As Prof. Thirumalai explains, the cerebellum shows an evolutionary continuity in all vertebrates, so, too, the Purkinje neurons. Even though fish and humans diverged from a common ancestor about 500 million years ago, the cerebellum has been evolutionarily conserved. While zebrafish have about 300-400 Purkinje neurons, humans have thousands of these.Dendrite arbours“Normally, levels of CaMKII are low in developing (immature) neurons and high in mature neurons, and the increased level actually freezes the development of dendrite arbours,” says Vatsala Thirumalai of NCBS, who led the work published in eLife. Dendrite arbours are branched ends of neurons, given this name because of their tree-like structure. “In the absence of gap junction protein, camk2 levels prematurely increase, preventing arbours from forming. Thus, chemical synapses do not form.”The work uses advanced techniques such as time-lapse microscopy and confocal microscopy which allowed the group to observe how the neuronal cells grow in the fish brain day after day. Electron microscopy was used to view slices of the brain to count the number of synapses present.To make the mutant fish with gjd2b protein knocked out, the group used the genome editing tool TALEN (Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nuclease). “It is possible to do such exciting research using the latest and most advanced tools and techniques in India today. I hope this trend will encourage more students to take up a career in research,” says Prof. Thirumalai.

Now researchers from University of Southern Denmark have discovered that oxygen is also produced without sunlight, possibly deep below the ocean surface.

Nitrosopumilus maritimus
and its cousins, called ammonia oxidising archaea play an important role in the nitrogen cycle. For this, they need oxygen. So it has been a long-standing puzzle why they are also very abundant in waters where there is no oxygen. The researchers found that these micro-organisms make their own oxygen, according to a University of Southern Denmark press release.
Keeps it going The researchers conducted tests in the lab and found that
N. maritimus
was using the oxygen present in water but the oxygen levels started increasing again in water. They micro-organisms were able to make oxygen even in a dark environment. Not sufficiently high to influence oxygen levels on Earth, but enough to keep itself going.
N. maritimus
couples the oxygen production to the production of gaseous nitrogen. By doing so they remove bioavailable nitrogen from the environment.

2018; 14:17-25) eczema was seen in 29% of a study group of subjects in the 60+ age group. Another study at the Base hospital of the Delhi Cantonment on the same age group reported that 56% of their subjects complained of pruritus (
Indian Dermatology Online Journal
, 10(5), 2019). In an analysis of 100 patients complaining of chronic itch. associated causes could be pinpointed in 62, and included diabetes, hypothyroidism, several cancers and Iron deficiency. (
Indian Journal of Clinical and Experimental Dermatology,
5: 130, 2019).
Factors that induce itch are called pruritogens. Tissues that are sensitive to itch include the skin, mucus membranes and the cornea of the eye. Some nerve fibres in these tissues (pruriceptors) are stimulated by pruritogens and the resulting signals are carried, via itch-signaling neurons in the spinal cord, to the brain. There are several different receptors and channels that respond to pruritogens. A great degree of redundancy in their roles ensures that no matter what, the itch sensation gets through to your brain.A common example of chronic itch is atopic dermatitis, an inflammatory condition showing cracked, itchy skin, which is often caused by allergens. As an example, it may be triggered by the house dust mite, barely a third of a millimeter in size, that feeds on the dead scaly skin that you shed all the time. Its faeces contains a protein which is a potent pruritogen. Upon binding to receptors in the skin, it elucidates allergic reactions such as atopic dermatitis, or asthma. These receptors are therapeutic targets, the aim being to block the itch sensation from being transduced to the brain, without hindering other sensations that protect you from harm.Not the same as painThe scratch response is a key difference between itch and pain. Sudden, sharp pain causes you to hurriedly retract and thus escape damage; scratching actually draws attention to the cause of the itch. Scratching evokes an inhibition of itch-signaling neurons in the spinal cord. This reduces the quantum of itch sensations that reach the brain. What a relief! But the respite is only short-lived – by scratching, you are inflicting mild pain, and in your brain, pain can momentarily overshadow the itch sensation. Scratching may even trigger reward systems in the brain, making it a pleasurable feeling. But for patients with chronic itch, scratching can be a bane, causing damage to the skin and aggravating the itch.Phantom itchesPeople who have lost a hand or leg often find that their ‘phantom limb’ itches profusely. Their brain rewires itself over time and signals from another part of the body now map to the region that earlier received somatosensory inputs from the limb. In a series of deceptively simple experiments, the neuroscientist V.S. Ramachandran of the University of California, San Diego, showed that people who have recently lost a limb in accidents and often complain of their ‘phantom hand itching like crazy’, could obtain relief by scratching various parts of their face – scratch the upper lip, and the absent index finger feels comforted, and so on.Novel therapeutic methods try to tackle chronic itch at many different points, from the skin to the central nervous system. UVB light is known to attenuate histamine release from immune cells in the skin, so phototherapy has proved useful. Garments of a silk that is coated with antimicrobial compounds are another strategy to soothe itching skin. Long-term itch leads to functional anomalies in the regions of the brain associated with itch, and non-invasive transcranial direct-current simulation has been shown to offer relief.(The article has been written jointly with Dr. Sushil Chandani, sushilchandani@gmail.com)dbala@lvpei.org

" joint study by Bharat Biotech and ICMR has provided the first evidence of the immune response of a homologous booster six months after the second dose. The randomised control trial was carried out on 184 participants belonging to the phase-2 trial arm that received 6 microgram of the vaccine for both first and second dose.The booster dose was found to be safe. The most frequent adverse events reported were mild and transient pain and itching at the injection site.The booster dose was given seven months (215 days) after the second dose. The primary outcome was to measure neutralising antibody titres four weeks after the booster shot. The results have been posted on a preprint server,
medRxiv
. Preprints are yet to be peer-reviewed.
The control arm had 93 participants and the intervention arm had 91 participants. However, majority of the 184 participants were younger than 55 years. In the case of the intervention arm, 85 of 91 participants were in the age group 18-55 years, while 82 of 93 participants belonged to the same age group in the control arm. The median age of participants in the intervention arm was 35 years; it was 36 years for the control arm.Small number“The study recruited only a very small number of people above 55 years of age — 6.6% in the vaccine arm and 7.5% in the placebo arm. Since the data are not broken up by age, we can't tell how well the booster worked in the most vulnerable age group,” Dr. Shahid Jameel, Director of the Trivedi School of Biosciences at Ashoka University, says in an email. “More detailed studies and a longer term follow up are needed.”From January 10, booters are being administered to those older than 60 years with comorbidities and to health-care and frontline workers. The reason for prioritising people above 60 years for a booster shot is because elderly people are relatively less likely to have developed sufficient antibodies after two doses.Low representationWith the booster dose study including just half-a-dozen participants over 55 years in each arm, the immune responses following a booster shot in the elderly is still not clearly known. But it was on March 23, 2021, that Bharat Biotech was permitted to conduct a booster dose trial using Covaxin by the Subject Expert Committee. At that time, only those in the phase-2 trial to test vaccine safety and immunogenicity had received the second dose more than six months ago, and hence the permission was granted to conduct the trial on these participants. The phase-2 trial that tested 6 mcg of the vaccine on 190 participants included only 10 individuals who were in the 55-65 years age group.Increase in antibodiesAbout three-fourths of the 184 participants still had neutralising antibody titres above baseline value at the end of six months after the second dose. “As expected, the booster dose shows an increase in neutralising antibody titres against the virus. What is even more pleasing is that the boosting effect is observed against all circulating variants (except Omicron, which was not studied),” Dr. Jameel says.Both the placebo and the intervention arms witnessed an increase in neutralising antibody levels. The increase in antibody levels in the control arm is most likely to be due to natural infection as the booster trial was conducted during the second wave.The increase in neutralising antibodies in both arms provides proof that repeated exposure to the virus antigen either through infection or vaccination leads to an increase in neutralising antibodies.Though studies carried outside India have found that infection leads to higher neutralising antibody levels and longer duration of protection against infection compared with vaccination, achieving protection through vaccination is safe and advisable.Elevated antibodiesThough neutralising antibody levels were found elevated in both control and intervention arms, the level of increase was higher in the intervention arm. For instance, four weeks after the booster shot, the control arm witnessed a fourfold increase in neutralising antibodies while the intervention arm witnessed a 31-fold increase.“Since even the placebo arm showed about 4-fold rise in titres (attributed to infection) and the same is expected in the vaccine arm, the actual boost by the vaccine is not about 30-fold but 30/4, which is 7.5-fold,” Dr. Jameel says.The sevenfold increase in neutralising antibodies in the vaccine arm compared to the placebo group following a booster dose becomes clear when the values of the plaque reduction neutralisation test of the two groups are compared. However, the microneutralisation test revealed that the antibody increase in the intervention arm was less than twofold than the control arm.“In the case of binding antibodies, the difference between the two arms is not statistically significant at the end of four weeks following the booster shot,” says Dr. Chandrakant Lahariya, physician-epidemiologist and public policy and health systems specialist.As part of another study, the sera samples from individuals who received a booster were tested to assess neutralising capacity against Delta and Omicron variants. While the preprint does not provide any details about neutralising studies against Omicron, a press release sent out by Bharat Biotech on January 12 says the sera samples from individuals who received a booster were found to be “effective in neutralizing Omicron variants on a live virus neutralization assay”.“More than 90% of all individuals boosted with Covaxin showed neutralizing antibodies,” the release says.“As the dominant COVID-19 variant throughout the world, Omicron poses a serious public health concern,” Dr. Mehul Suthar from Emory Vaccine Center and who led the laboratory analysis says in the release. “Data from this preliminary analysis show individuals receiving a booster dose of Covaxin have a significant immune response to both the Omicron and Delta variants. These findings suggest that a booster dose has the potential to reduce disease severity and hospitalisations.”The study recruited only very small number of people above 55 years of age : 6.6% in the vaccine arm and 7.5% in the placebo arm.Dr. Shahid JameelAshoka University

"Crucial link: Without vitamin D, muscles continued to make glycogen, but could not convert it to glucose, as Dr. Aneeshkumar (right) explains. Special arrangement iStockphoto

Skeletal muscles normally brim with energy, yet they starve in the absence of Vitamin D, says recent research led by Aneeshkumar A. G. of National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi. This research demonstrates that glycogen stored in the skeletal muscles is not converted into a usable form of energy without Vitamin D.Usually, the glucose absorbed from the food is converted into glycogen and stored in the skeletal muscle. This stored energy reserve is used by muscles to produce energy after the food consumed is digested. However, in the absence of vitamin D, the skeletal muscle is starved of energy, decreasing muscle mass.Muscle wastingVitamin D deficiency is often associated with rickets. In rickets, the bone tissue does not correctly mineralise calcium and phosphorus, leading to softening of bones resulting in skeletal deformities. However, we are becoming aware that vitamin D works more as a hormone than and is involved in a host of biochemical reactions. It is key to maintaining metabolic functions, immune system, bone health and plays a crucial role in depression, mood swings, anxiety and sleep quality.As part of the normal metabolic process, proteins produced in our body degrade, and in due course, new proteins are made to replace them. Usually, when the protein degradation exceeds protein synthesis, skeletal muscle atrophy or simply a decrease in muscle mass occurs.""We wanted to find out the molecular nature of muscle dysfunction in the absence of vitamin D. We started with the hypothesis that the root cause is metabolic dysfunction. We used a mouse model which does not have a vitamin D receptor:[VDR] a protein that binds to vitamin D and switches several genes on or off to test our hypotheses,"" says Dr. Aneeshkumar.Hungry cellsTypically, the protein synthesis is high when the digestion of the food is taking place and is slower during the post-absorptive state when the digestion is completed. ""In order to examine if the protein degradation and subsequent muscle wasting occur primarily during the absorptive or post-absorptive phase, we compared the protein synthesis during both the phases. In control mice, the levels were as expected. Nevertheless, in mice lacking VDR after the weaning stage of growth, the protein synthesis was impaired during the post-absorptive stage,"" explains Dr. Aneeshkumar, and adds, ""without the vitamin D receptor there was a general increase in protein degradation and a decrease in post-absorptive protein synthesis.""Initially, scientists suspected that the absence of VDR is preventing the synthesis of glycogen from the food. ""We checked whether the energy deprivation in skeletal muscles is associated with differences in glycogen levels,"" says Dr. Aneeshkumar. To their surprise, VDR knockout mice had higher glycogen levels than the control ones. ""We found that the glycogen synthase, the key enzyme that converts glucose into glycogen, was having a field day without the inhibitory enzymes active"". More and more glycogen was being produced and stored in the skeletal muscle.Nevertheless, the glycogen phosphorylase, an enzyme that converts glycogen to glucose when energy is needed, was significantly lower. ""As a result, while muscle continued to make glycogen, none of it could be converted back to glucose resulting in energy deficiency,"" explains Dr. Aneeshkumar. Even with abundant glycogen present, the skeletal muscle could not extract the energy in the absence of vitamin D.""From this research, we think we have found the molecular mechanism by which the vitamin D deficiency leads to muscle wasting. Without vitamin D, glycogen storage cannot be utilised for glucose production. When the glycogen storage does not give energy, particularly in a post-absorb state, the skeletal muscle draws more glucose from the blood. This leads to a systemic energy shortage. When there is systemic lack of energy, like during hunger, the protein degradation in muscle is triggered leading to muscle wasting,"" explains Dr. Aneeshkumar. ""Although our study is in mice, we think this mechanism is broadly applicable in humans as well,"" he said.(T.V. Venkateswaran is a scientist with Vigyan Prasar and is a science communicator.)In mice lacking VDR after the weaning stage of growth, the protein synthesis was impaired during the post-absorptive stage.

"ow do locusts smell an odour? The ability to smell coffee immaterial of the presence of other interfering smells or the environment remains the same in humans. In effect, other smells or different environmental factors do not get in the way of our ability to experience the smell of individual odours. Researchers at Washington University in St. Louis found the answer as to why this happens by studying locusts
(Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences).Locusts were trained to associate an odour with food, their preference being a blade of grass. In six presentations, the locust learned to open its sensory appendages close to the mouth in expectation of a snack after smelling the ‘training odourant’.The researchers studied which neurons were fired when the locust was exposed to the odour under different conditions.Under different circumstances, highly inconsistent patterns of neurons were activated even though the locust appendage close to the mouth opened every time.They turned to machine-learning algorithms to understand this. It turned out that the locust exploited two functional types of neurons: those that are activated when an odourant is present, and those which are silenced when an odourant is present but become activated after the odour presentation ends, says the university press release.To recognise an odourant's presence, researchers simply needed to add evidence for the odourant being present and subtract evidence against that odour being present.",0,1,0,0

"n the State-wise data compiled by the Union Government, represented by the Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati in the Supreme Court, it was shown based on media reports that 6,14,211 claims of compensation for deaths due to COVID-19 were filed in 20 States against the reported death toll of 4,29,872 in those States. The numbers were stark for some States. Telangana reported only 3,993 deaths but received 28,969 compensation claims and sanctioned compensation for 15,720 deaths (nearly four times the reported death toll). Gujarat reported only 10,094 deaths but there were 89,633 compensation claims, and 68,370 of them were sanctioned – a multiple of nearly seven times the reported death toll. In contrast, Kerala which reported 49,300 deaths has received 27,274 compensation claims and has processed 23,652 of them.Reflect undercountingNow, compensation claims are not a reliable measure of what the actual death toll due to COVID-19 could have been – in States, where there is greater State responsiveness and general public awareness, claims of compensation could be more, and this could be lower in States with limited capacities. Yet, the fact that some States have gone to process a high number of compensation claims, several multiples over and above their reported death tolls suggest that their governments have acknowledged that these tolls reflect an undercounting of the actual death tally.Excess deathsThis is not surprising. Excess deaths analyses based on deaths registered in the Civil Registration System (CRS) have shown that they have been as high as six times the official death toll for just 11 States and Union Territories (Maharashtra, Punjab, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh) for which such data was available. Studies have found the CRS method to analyse death tolls to be a robust way to measure mortality across States. The more complete the CRS registration in States, “the better the opportunities to understand population health and its determinants,” a paper by Aashish Gupta and others recently found. A recent peer-reviewed paper in
Science
by Prabhat Jha and others used a national survey of 1.4 lakh adults and estimated that COVID-19 constituted 29% of deaths from June 2020 to July 2021. This corresponds to 32 lakh deaths, of which 27 lakh occurred in April–July 2021. This number was corroborated with two government data sources – one of which was the CRS and which showed all-cause mortality increased by 27% and 26% respectively, leading them to conclude that “India’s cumulative COVID-19 deaths were six-seven times higher than reported official mortality with COVID and non-COVID deaths peaking similarly”.
There could have been a possible overreporting of deaths in the national survey conducted by CVOTER. The authors went on to address this by reaching out to approximately 57,000 people in 13,500 households, and this showed “similar temporal increases in mortality with COVID and non-COVID deaths peaking similarly”.Worldwide phenomenon Is this an Indian phenomenon alone? A recent news feature published in
Nature
journal based on the World Mortality Dataset maintained by researcher Ariel Karlinsky, besides other models, found that across countries the pandemic's true death toll was millions more than the official tolls. For example, the WMD dataset revealed that excess deaths in Russia numbered more than one million by the end of 2021, while only 3,00,000 COVID-19 deaths were recorded in the same period. The WMD dataset does not contain figures for India as excess deaths are available only for “subnational” units (States) and not for the whole country or for countries such as China. But extrapolating from subnational data, it could be shown, as the
Science
paper did for India, that excess deaths were several multiples over the official death toll and revealed undercounting.
 A data story in
The Hindu
published in September 2021 compared excess deaths for the countries with the highest reported death toll and found that the estimated multiple over the reported toll (using the same method) for India was the highest (5.8 times) and only Chile (5.7 times) came close.
Varied reasonsWhat explains this substantive undercounting of deaths? In the case of India, the reasons are varied. In States like Kerala which have tallied a high number of deaths after reviewing its COVID-19 mortality reporting over time, initially, some deaths of infected people who died after testing negative or left hospitals and then died were not tallied under COVID-19 deaths. This has since been corrected, and Kerala’s case fatality rate has risen to 0.9 (closer to the national average).But in others such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana, where excess deaths multiples were quite high, the reasons for the undercounting have also got to do with the States seeking to report less of the mortality as COVID-related. There are States such as Uttar Pradesh, for example, where public health systems remain weak and were overwhelmed by the sudden increase in the spurt of infections and mortality during the second wave, in particular. This also contributed to the significant underreporting of COVID-19 deaths. Many cases were not detected through adequate testing in several States. Also, the absence of proper health care institutions resulted in several deaths occurring outside institutional care and were undocumented.States with a robust CRS (Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala for example) in which deaths are quickly registered after occurrence have tended to show lower excess deaths multiples or have addressed these deaths as COVID-19 related after audits – Maharashtra, for example.But as the Gujarat example shows, even if undercounting of deaths was done for political expediency, such States have had to acknowledge compensation claims even if they are much higher than the reported COVID-19 tolls for the same reason.Estimating the actual death toll due to COVID-19 is an important step in acknowledging the challenges faced by public health institutions and the state in India. This should help epidemiologists and public health specialists devise clear steps to take when faced with a pandemic-like situation and also to prepare institutions to respond to it.

"ver a year ago, alert press reporters found a device hanging around Congress M.P. Shashi Tharoor’s neck. Was it a GPS device, Translator or a small dictionary? He tweeted that it was “An air purifier (negative ioniser).” Its sellers claim that the device emits two million healthy negative ions per sec from the black brush on its top. These ions may impinge on pollutants, make them negatively charged and get them collected on surfaces of tables, windows, bed etc. Whether it helps to reduce pollution in real life, or not needs scientific validation. Is copious emission of negative ions from it a red flag?On December 16, 2021, the Authority for Nuclear Safety and Radiation Protection (ANVS), Netherland issued a statement identifying ten products such as (Magnetix Magnetic necklace, Magnetix Sport boost bracelet, Smiley Kids bracelet, Athletic necklace among others) as containing more radioactivity than legally permitted. The agency cautioned the public against using “Quantum Pendant,” “anti-5G pendant” or “negative ion” jewellery items or sleep mask. Often, “negative ion products” may contain radioactive substances. The ANVS clarified that their warning does not apply to ionic air purifiers, “as they are known not to contain radioactive materials.” Obviously, Dr Tharoor need not worry over any red flag!Radioactive productsSellers of “negative ion” consumer products and “scalar energy products” claim that these products improve the user's health. They may state that they are composed of volcanic ash, minerals etc. These can contain radioactive substances, which emit ionising radiation, which can cause tissue damage and are bad for the user's health.Popular online platforms have been offering such products, often in the form of pendants, necklaces, bracelets, sleep masks etc. for many years now. Manufacturing and selling products containing radioactive substances is not a justified practice. The ANVS found that the level of radiation in these products is low and the risk of health problems is also low. The agency informed all known vendors of these products in the Netherlands that it has prohibited their sale and that they must stop trading in these products immediately.Wearing such products for a long period (a year, 24 hours a day) could expose the wearer to a dose of radiation that exceeds the limit for skin exposure prescribed in the Netherlands.Above dose limitMalaysian researchers led by H.L. Hassan, Department of Physics, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia found that eight out of the 20 pendants, they evaluated, by using state-of-the-art methods were capable of exposing the wearers to an annual effective dose above the dose limit of one mSv for public (PLOS ONE June 1, 2021). The dose from the most radioactive pendant was 2.8 mSv/year.(When the physical energy absorbed by tissues from x-rays, gamma rays or electrons is one Joule per kg, the biologically effective dose is considered to be one Sv. Since Sv is a huge unit, specialists use milliSv - one thousandth of a Sv - as a unit; skin dose in a chest x-ray exam is about 0.1 mSv).Undergarment samplesIn another IAEA supported project, Hassan and others from Malaysia, the U.K. and Spain found that the undergarment industry in Malaysia and elsewhere advertised that their “negative ion undergarments” contain tourmaline, monazite and zircon, all known to contain uranium and thorium. Among the 13 samples of undergarments they assessed, three were capable of exposing their wearers to annual effective doses above one mSV, the IAEA reference level (Applied Sciences, June 10, 2021).Realising the safety significance of Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (NORM), IAEA and member countries provided guidance on the matter.In “Radiation Protection and Safety of radiation Sources: International Basic Safety Standards” (2014), the IAEA considers that the frivolous use of radiation or radioactive substances in toys and personal jewellery or adornments, which result in an increase in activity, is unjustified.The IAEA also published a specific safety guide titled “Radiation Safety for Consumer Products (2016).” The Atomic Energy (Radiation Protection) Rules, 2004 contains provisions consistent with those of the IAEA.Be aware of the facts before using consumer products containing radioactive substances or presenting them to anyone!(K.S.

"Signs of infection: Shelf-like basidiomata, the fruiting or reproductive structures of the fungus, grow on the tree trunks. Arun Kumar ARUN KUMAR
| Photo Credit: ARUN KUMAR
 Researchers from Kerala have identified two new species of fungi from the genus
Ganoderma
that are associated with coconut stem rot. They have also genotyped the two fungi species, named
Ganoderma keralense
and
G. pseudoapplanatum
and identified genetic biomarkers. The DNA barcodes have been made publicly available in DNA sequence repositories so that future studies can use it for early detection of the pathogen. The research was published in the journal
Mycologia.Basal stem rot The butt rot or basal stem rot of coconut is known by several names in different parts of India: Ganoderma wilt (Andhra Pradesh),
Anaberoga
(Karnataka) and Thanjavur wilt (Tamil Nadu), to mention a few.
 The infection begins at the roots, but symptoms include discolouration and rotting of stem and leaves. In the later stages, flowering and nut set decreases and finally the coconut palm
(Cocos nucifera)
dies.
A reddish brown oozing is seen. This oozing has been reported only in India. Once infected, recovery of the plants is not likely. Not surprising then, that this causes a huge loss: By some estimates made in 2017, in India, around 12 million people are said to depend on coconut farming.Late signs  Another sign of infection is presence of shelf-like “basidiomata,” which are the fruiting or reproductive structures of the fungus, on the tree trunks. “Although microscopic, many fungi… produce macroscopic fruiting structures on the substrates where they grow [for example,
Ganoderma
],” says T.K. Arun Kumar of Zamorin’s Guruvayurappan College, Kohikode, who led this research, in an email. He further explains that the basidiomata of
Ganoderma
bear reproductive propagules (called spores) which are dispersed through wind and sometimes with the help of insects. “That is how the pathogen spreads from one host to the other,” he adds.
Since the fungus is microscopic, it is only detected after the symptoms start manifesting or when the reproductive structures are borne, which can be too late.Lack of taxonomy Surprisingly, before this study, the disease was commonly attributed to the genus
Ganoderma
and the specific species involved were not identified correctly. One reason for this could be the lack of studies focusing on taxonomy. “Plant pathologists may be very good at identifying diseases based on disease symptoms, devising strategies to prevent disease occurrence and even in developing disease resistant plants. However, there is a dearth of fungal taxonomists among plant pathologists who are able to identify fungal pathogens with accuracy,” says Dr Arun Kumar.
 The two-member team collected the material for their research during the years 2015 to 2019. “There was a large-scale outbreak of the disease in Kozhikode district, Kerala, a few years back and our examination of the collected fungal specimens along with collections [over many years] from plantations throughout Kerala revealed that the identity of pathogenic species was hitherto unrecognised,” says Dr Arun Kumar. This led him and PhD student N. Vinjusha to study the specimens further, first morphologically and then through genome sequencing. The two species seemed to be new to science. “This discovery was based on morphological characters, DNA sequences of the Kerala collections and phylogenetic analyses by comparing DNA of all
Ganoderma
species known worldwide,” says Dr Arun Kumar. The research has revealed the identity of the pathogenic species associated with butt rot. Hence, species-specific disease prevention strategies can now be developed.
As Dr Arun Kumar says: “So far, scientists and farmers had to solely rely on the visible symptoms of the disease [which appear only at a later stage, after complete colonization], but now they can easily detect the presence of the pathogen much earlier by analysing plant extracts which can be easily obtained at any stage of growth.”The fungus is microscopic, so is only detected after symptoms show or when reproductive structures are borne, which can be too late.

"an insect larvae display jump behaviour? A team of researchers from North Carolina State University's Plant Disease and Insect Clinic has discovered a jumping behaviour that is entirely new to insect larvae, and there is evidence that it is occurring in a range of species. The previously unrecorded behaviour occurs in the larvae of a species of lined flat bark beetle
(Laemophloeus biguttatus)
. Specifically, the larvae are able to spring into the air, with each larva curling itself into a loop as it leaps forward.
While there are other insect species that are capable of making prodigious leaps, they rely on something called a “latch-mediated spring actuation mechanism”. This means that they essentially have two parts of their body latch onto each other while the insect exerts force, building up a significant amount of energy. The insect then unlatches the two parts, releasing all of that energy at once, allowing it to spring off the ground. What makes the
L. biguttatus
so remarkable is that it makes these leaps without latching two parts of its body together. It uses claws on its legs to grip the ground while it builds up that potential energy — and once those claws release their hold on the ground, that potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, launching it skyward.
 To determine how
L. biguttatus
was able to execute its acrobatics, the researchers filmed the jumps at speeds of up to 60,000 frames per second",0,1,0,0

NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission has spotted three huge Jupiter-like extrasolar planets that are orbiting dangerously close to their giant or sub-giant stars. One of them, TOI-2337b, is likely to get absorbed by its star in less than a million years, the shortest for any known exoplanet. The study helps in understanding the past, present and future of planets.

"he Omicron variant became the dominant variant infecting both vaccinated and the unvaccinated persons in many countries just one month after the World Health Organization designated it a variant of concern on November 26, 2021. Two months since, Omicron has become the dominant variant in every country that is witnessing a new wave. In short, Omicron has replaced the Delta variant, which was considered highly transmissive in almost every country across the world.One of the defining features of a new variant is the higher transmissibility than the existing variant. If the Delta variant was found to be highly transmissible when compared with the Alpha variant, the Omicron variant has been found to be extremely transmissive when compared with the Delta variant.Early studiesEarlier studies suggested that the extremely high transmissibility of the Omicron variant was probably due to higher viral load in an infected person. The higher the viral load in a person, the greater are the chances that the infected person can successfully spread it to others. This is because the infected person tends to release larger amounts of the virus. While the Delta variant require a relatively longer period of exposure before a person gets infected, the Omicron variant has been found to spread within a few minutes of exposure. But the results of a study posted in
medRxiv
preprint server (and is yet to be peer-reviewed) has found that the viral load is nearly the same with both variants — Delta and Omicron.
Backed by mutationsWith the Omicron variant possessing many mutations that allows it to escape the immune system better even in previously infected or fully vaccinated people, the extremely high rate at which the Omicron variant is spreading might be due to inherent immune escape capabilities rather than the high viral load as it was previously thought.A team led by researchers from the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts, obtained longitudinal, quantitative RT-PCR test results of swabs taken from the nose and throat of over 10,300 players from the National Basketball Association, the organisation responsible for professional basketball in North America. The period of study was restricted between July 5, 2021 and January 10, this year. From the beginning of the pandemic the players and other people associated with the Association have been undergoing regular testing. The league conducts frequent COVID-19 testing of its players and personnel.The researchers used RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values of less than 30 as a proxy for viral load. The PCR test amplifies the genetic material from coronavirus through multiple cycles. Since the coronavirus has RNA, it is first converted into DNA, and each cycle of amplification doubles the amount of DNA.If there is just one DNA molecule to start with, the amount of DNA after 30 cycles of amplification will be one billion molecules. If there is more genetic material to begin with then fewer cycles of amplification would be sufficient to detect the DNA.Surprising resultsWhile the researchers were expecting that people infected with the Omicron variant would show higher viral load, the results were the just opposite. “The peak viral RNA based on Ct values was lower for Omicron infections than for Delta infections,” they write. For Omicron, the Cycle threshold (Ct) was 23.3, while for Delta the cycle threshold was 20.5. “These results suggest that Omicron’s infectiousness may not be explained by higher viral load measured in the nose and mouth by RT-PCR,” they write.The clearance phase was also shorter for Omicron infections — 5.35 days — while for Delta it was 6.23 days.Omicron and Delta Another team led by researchers from the University of Geneva, Switzerland, went a step further to measure the number of infectious virus particles present on the swabs collected from 150 infected people. The results are posted on preprint server
medRxiv,
and the paper is yet to be peer-reviewed. They found that breakthrough infections caused by the Delta variant had lower number of virus particles than unvaccinated people with Delta infection. Surprisingly, the number of virus particles in vaccinated individuals with Omicron infection was comparable with individuals with Delta breakthrough infections.
Contrary to the previous notion that people infected with Omicron have higher viral loads than those infected with the Delta variant, the study by the University of Geneva found that vaccinated people infected with Delta or Omicron had nearly similar viral loads.The peak viral RNA based on Ct values was lower for Omicron infections than for Delta infections

"Fine repertoire: Pseudophilautus amboli (shown above) produces calls with six-note types, says K.S. Seshadri from Centre for Ecological Sciences, IISc, Bengaluru K. S. Seshadri K. S. Seshadri

 Frogs have different types of call to suit different occasions, a new study finds. It was known that birds sing different songs depending on context, yet this kind of behaviour has not been documented among the so-called simpler animals, the anurans (frogs and toads). This study, conducted by researchers from Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, and Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, has been published in the journal
Animal Behaviour.Semantics and frogsWhen we humans speak, we use words to build up sentences. Only some arrangements of words have meaning and this is what we use. The same appears to be true of frogs, too. Some typical needs among frogs are to communicate a mating call to attract a member of the opposite sex and to guard one’s territory against other males. It is important that the calls given out in such different contexts be unambiguous, so that both, the calling frog and the listening frog, understand the difference. However, frogs have a limited repertoire of “notes,” and hence, using different notes for different contexts is impossible. “We wished to address whether these frogs arrange their notes into sequences in different ways in different contexts,” says Ananda Shikhara Bhat, the first author of the paper, who is with the Department of Biology, IISER Pune. The group studied two species of frog – Humayun’s Night Frog
(Nyctibatrachus humayuni)
and Amboli Bush Frog
(Pseudophilautus amboli).Two species “While
N. humayuni
produces calls with two notes (ascending and descending),
P. amboli
produces calls with six-note types,” says K.S. Seshadri from Centre for Ecological Sciences, IISc, Bengaluru, who along with Anand Krishnan of Department of Biology, IISER, Pune, led the study. Dr. Seshadri explains that they found that alone, individuals of
N. humayuni
produce a single ascending note but in the presence of another male of the same species, the individual adds up to seven descending notes to the ascending note. “In contrast, individuals of
P. amboli
use a different set of note types [note type 1–3, as classified by the authors] when alone or when in the presence of another male but use note types 4–5 when engaging in a physical fight with another male,” he adds.
 Shikhara Bhat and Varun Sane who is now a researcher at the University of Cambridge, U.K., recorded the calls of
N. humayuni
in June–July 2019 from roadside streams in Adarwadi and Matheran in Maharashtra. The calls of
P. amboli
were recorded at Sirsi in Karnataka, in July 2020. “Calls from 19
N. humayuni
and 50
P. amboli
individuals were recorded and used for analysis,” say the researchers.
This is the first study to examine “sequences” of vocalisations in frogs. “To the best of our knowledge, our novel data analysis method, named ‘co-occurrence analysis’, is the first of its kind that is free of assumptions about the underlying data, and is widely applicable to analysing vocal sequences of all sorts of animals,” says Shikhara Bhat.Endemic to region“Both species of anurans are endemic to the Western Ghats. The two species were chosen intentionally because they were common where they are found and belong to two distantly related lineages of anurans,” says Dr. Seshadri. This allowed the researchers to examine if and to what extent the vocalisations varied.“Ask anyone if they know how frogs call, and they will likely say ‘Croak’ or ‘Ribbit’. Our work shows that anurans go beyond this simplistic [picture]. Some of the anurans, half the size of our thumb, are capable of stringing together sounds with varying levels of complexity depending on the context.” says Dr. Seshadri.

"s it possible to regrow a frog’s lost leg? Researchers have come a step closer to the goal of regenerative medicine by successfully triggering regrowth of a lost leg in a frog using a five-drug cocktail contained in a silk protein gel and kept in place over the stump for a day. That brief treatment sets in motion an 18-month period of regrowth that restores a functional leg. The research was carried out by scientists at Tufts University and Harvard University's Wyss Institute
(Science Advances)
.
The researchers triggered the regenerative process in African clawed frogs by enclosing the wound in a silicone cap, which they call a BioDome, containing a silk protein gel loaded with the five-drug cocktail.Each drug fulfilled a different purpose.. The combination and the bioreactor provided a local environment and signals that tipped the scales away from the natural tendency to close off the stump, and toward the regenerative process, according to a press release from Tufts University.The researchers observed dramatic growth of tissue in many of the treated frogs, re-creating an almost fully functional leg. The new limbs had bone structure extended with features similar to a natural limb's bone structure, a richer complement of internal tissues (including neurons), and several ""toes"" grew from the end of the limb, although without the support of underlying bone.The regrown limb moved and responded to stimuli such as a touch from a stiff fibre, and the frogs were able to make use of it for swimming through water, moving much like a normal frog would.

"sing its expertise in genome sequencing and analysis pipeline of genome sequence data, the Delhi-based CSIR lab Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) has successfully developed a unique pool of primers and kits to be used in RT-PCR testing of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The most distinguishing aspect of the work carried by a team led by Dr. Sridhar Sivasubbu and Dr. Vinod Scaria at IGIB that was developing primers that will not be affected by mutations seen in SARS-CoV-2 variants. This may allow the primers to detect any new SARS-CoV-2 variants that might emerge immaterial of the novel mutations that the variants might have. The primers developed in a way future-proofs the ability to detect without fail any new SARS-CoV-2 variants that may emerge.Many mutationsThe Omicron variant, for instance, has 32 mutations in the spike protein alone. None of these mutations were seen in other variants that emerged earlier — the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta. Each new variant that emerges develops a unique set of mutations that makes it more transmissible and/or causes severe disease.RT-PCR tests currently available contain primers for two or more genes. The gene targets selected could be a combination of S gene, N gene and E- gene.Based on over 40,000 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 virus genome sequence data available in the public domain including a significant large number of genome sequences from India, Dr. Sivasubbu’s team, which includes two PhD students — Paras Sehgal and Gyan Ranjan, was able to identify nearly 80,000 unique variants. The high number of variants seen is because SARS-CoV-2 is a rapidly mutating virus and tends to collect mutations during infection. The SARS-CoV-2 is naturally endowed to collect about one mutation every 10-14 days.“Though the SARS-CoV-2 is a rapidly mutating virus, we found that not all regions of the virus were accumulating mutations at the same rate. There are some regions of the virus which collect mutations at a fast rate while some other regions tend to collect mutations at a slow rate,” says Dr. Sivasubbu.“We at IGIB already had an algorithm that allowed us to look at the conserved regions that were not prone to accumulating mutations.. This allowed us to analyse which regions of the virus are conserved and which were not,” says Dr. Sivasubbu.Conserved region of a virus contains genes which are very essential and hence either do not undergo any mutations or such mutations happen rarely.In parallel, the IGIB researchers had also collected information about primers used in commercial and non-commercial tests across the world. “Once we had the mutation map of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and by using the information gathered by studying the primers used across the world, we found that a majority of primers designed and used were overlapping with the regions of the virus collecting significant number of mutations,” he says.Strategic problem“The primers widely in use have a small strategic problem. We realised that at some point in the future, the existing primers used in RT-PCR test kits for detecting SARS-CoV-2 virus would not be able to bind properly to the genome leading to erroneous results,” Dr. Sivasubbu says. The primers were tested to detect all the SARS-CoV-2 variants — the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron. Based on the knowledge of the conserved regions in the virus, the team developed a pool of primers that would be future-proof. Each RT-PCR test uses at least two gene targets and each gene target requires a pair of primers. The pool of primers developed by IGIB will allow them to be used in various combinations.“The pool of primers has been developed to target regions of the virus which are unlikely to undergo mutations. So the primers developed for RT-PCR tests will perform very well when new variants emerge,” says Dr. Anurag Agrawal, Director of IGIB.The development of the mutation map of SARS-CoV-2 virus and the pool of primers were done in collaboration with Siemens Healthcare Private Limited. The technology has been transferred to the company and the product tested and approved by ICMR and launched on January 25 this year.Siemens will be manufacturing the tests (IMDX SARS-CoV-2 Multiplex ORF1ab/N gene) at its new plant at Vadodara. According to the company spokesperson, the tests have 100% sensitivity and specificity. The plant has a capacity to manufacture 12 million tests per month. “The company will strive to make it affordable and accessible,” the spokesperson said.Used worldwideThe project began in May–June 2020 when Illumina launched its new Covidseq Next-Generation Sequencing for SARS-CoV-2 virus and the first global field validation was carried out in India at IGIB. Nearly 1,700 genome sequence samples from seven States were sequenced at IGIB using Covidseq Next-Generation Sequencing as part of the field validation. Once the field validation by IGIB was completed, countries across the world started using Illumina’s new Covidseq genome sequencing protocol. By the end of December 2020, a large number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes were sequenced across the world, including 7,000 from India. Of the 7,000 genomes sequenced in India, 50% were exclusively by IGIB in collaboration with other entities in India.

"Entangled dice: The existence of a quantum solution to the 36 officers problem implies that 4 unbiased dice can be prepared so that observing any two of them can be used to perfectly predict the other two. Paulina Rajchel-Mieldzioc Paulina Rajchel-Mieldzioc
| Photo Credit: SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT
A famous problem that has perplexed mathematicians since 1779 has been settled, but with a quantum twist, by a collaboration of six Indian and Polish researchers, two of whom are from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras. The researchers have solved using matrix methods, the quantum equivalent of the classical problem. This could potentially be used in quantum secret sharing protocols – which will be useful when quantum computers come into play; parallel teleportation, which is a way to transferring information across distances; and even perhaps may come in useful in solving the problem of quantum gravity.Long-lived puzzlesNumerical puzzles often appear simple when phrased but can occupy mathematicians for hundreds of years. The 36 officers puzzle was first posed by Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler.The puzzle can be described as follows:There are six regiments, each containing six officers of six different ranks. The question is, can you place the 36 officers in a square arrangement with six rows and six columns such that no row or column repeats an officer’s rank or regiment?This puzzle was guessed to be unsolvable by Euler in 1779 and proven to be so by the French amateur mathematician G. Tarry in 1901.Squares such as this are often encountered in Sudoku and other magic squares of size n. Euler’s 36 officers problem (for which n=6) and generalisations of it to other values of n = 2,3, etc are examples of Orthogonal Latin Squares (OLS). In this case, OLS solutions exist for all values of n except 2 and 6.A quantum solutionNow Tarry had explicitly shown that n = 6 (36 officers puzzle) has no solution. But suppose the officers were not classical objects but were quantum entities, would this still be true? This is what physicists who joined the group of problem solvers started asking.Classically, this problem cannot be solved, but what if the officers were quantum entities?Here, it is necessary to understand “quantum entanglement”.To get an idea, take 2 boxes, one in Chennai and other in Shopian, one containing a red (R) cube and other a blue (B) one. We think of the state as RB or BR depending on if the Chennai box contains a red or blue cube. A quantum entangled state, is a weird “superposition” of these two which physicists represent by RB+BR. The strange thing about this state is that opening the Chennai box can randomly reveal it to contain a blue or red cube and the nature of entanglement is to ensure that the other distant box contains a cube of the opposite colour. Repeating the experiment with an identical set of boxes, can result in the reverse colours immediately. This leads to what is popularly known as ``spooky action at a distance”, and maximal entanglement leads to perfect correlation.Another famous example is that of Schrodinger’s cat.Officers entangledIn the case of quantum officers, the state may similarly exist in a superposition of officer states. One of the things the researchers have shown is that there is a connection between the classical OLS solutions, whenever it exists, and the nature of the quantum state associated with it. It can be used to construct what are called Absolutely Maximally Entangled (AME) states. These are states in which any subset of the entities is maximally correlated with the others in the sense of the red and blue cubes above.In the case Euler’s problem, starting from the quantum equivalent of what is nearly an OLS solution, the researchers run an algorithm that tunes it and tries to approach the perfect AME state which will be the quantum OLS in the forbidden dimension n=6. “Given that we were studying a 36-dimensional matrix, which contained 1,296 entries, it was like looking for a needle in a haystack,” says Arul Lakshminarayan from IIT Madras, who led the study along with Karol Zyczkowski of Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland. “When we ran the algorithm, we realized that we should not start from the neighbourhood of the approximate solution but somewhat away from it,” says Suhail Ahmad Rather, who is a PhD student in his fourth year at IIT Madras and one of the first authors of the paper which has been accepted for publication in
Physical Review Letters.
“There is an art involved in it,” says Prof. Lakshminarayan.
An amusing twist to the story comes in when you consider the three amplitudes a, b and c, that made up the solution. The three form a Pythagorean triad, that is, a2 + b2 = c2. Further the ration b/a was the golden mean (approximately equal to 1.618) which is seen in many natural and constructed patterns. Is there then something more to the story? Is this, as Prof. Lakshminarayan feels, the tip of an iceberg?Given that we were studying a 36-dimensional matrix, it was like looking for a needle in a haystack.Arul Lakshminarayan

"he art of medicine is taught by the bedside. It involves detailed history-taking, followed by a physical examination which employs the senses of the physician. Humans, however, prefer concrete numbers to abstract skill and intuition. Unfortunately, most of these numbers do not have any clinical relevance. Yet, they continue to be used indiscriminately to drive irrational and often expensive treatments, including unnecessary hospitalisations. At present, the most often repeated number appears to be the cycle threshold value (Ct value) reported on an RT-PCR at the time of diagnosis.RT-PCR testAn RT-PCR test detects genetic material in a sample (for COVID, the sample used is a swab from the throat and nose). The sample, after processing, is placed in an RT-PCR machine where the viral genetic material is amplified. So two copies of genetic material become four, four become eight in the next cycle and so on. There are fluorescent marker labels present in the mixture, which attach to the genetic material and release a fluorescent dye, which is measured by the machine as it happens (“real-time”). When the fluorescence crosses a certain threshold, the machine labels the sample as testing positive, and the number of cycles that the sample goes through before reaching this threshold is called the cycle threshold (or Ct value). It follows, therefore, that greater the quantum of genetic material (or virus) in the sample, fewer the cycles to reach the threshold of detection. For approximately every 3.3 rise in the Ct value, the quantum of starting genetic material is likely to be tenfold lower.When a swab is done in a symptomatic individual at the peak of early symptoms, the Ct value is more often than not low. This leads patients to believe that they are at a high risk of having severe disease. The consequent fear and anxiety lead to frequent blood tests, scans and a gamut of unproven therapies. This is unscientific for several reasons.Dynamic measure Firstly, the Ct value is a dynamic measure and can evolve rapidly. A low Ct value at the time of diagnosis does not mean that it will stay low the next day (as the body’s immunity kicks in). Similarly, a swab done very early in the infection may reveal a high Ct value, which if repeated a day or two later, may reveal a lower Ct value. It is possibly for this reason that Ct values have not been convincingly correlated with disease severity, and serve no role in predicting the trajectory for a patient (yet, this is commonly used as an argument to prescribe tests and medicines). Secondly, several technical and logistical factors influence the value: the way specimens are collected (a quick superficial swab versus an aggressive swab), the type of specimen (nasal versus pharyngeal versus nasopharyngeal), the medium in which the swab is transported, the time lag between collection of the specimen and processing. All of this can influence the quantum of viral genetic material present, and subsequently, the Ct value. In a letter published in C
linical Infectious Diseases,
the College of American Pathologists (CAP) Microbiology Committee reports how a survey of 700 laboratories in the U.S. using standardised proficiency testing material from the same batch found a variability in Ct values by 14 cycles. Even within the same test at the same lab the Ct values could vary by 3 cycles for different target genes, and up to 12 cycles for the same target gene across labs. The letter reiterated the fact that these RT-PCR assays were not approved to be used quantitatively, but as a positive/negative test.
The caveatsDoes the Ct value have any real value at all? Studies suggest that when used early in the disease, it may correlate with transmissibility at the time of testing. This, again, needs to be viewed with the caveats of the dynamic nature of the value, and the unfeasibility of serial testing, in addition to the technical variability alluded to above. When used to decide when a person can come out of isolation in high-risk settings such as hospitals, the Ct value may be a guide in older patients, those who are immunocompromised and those who have severe disease, all of which are patient groups in whom prolonged viral shedding has been reported.The knowledge of the Ct value offers no insight to the treating clinician or the patient, and amounts to “noise” without a meaningful clinical “signal”. It causes panic, and the value is being used to drive irrational testing and treatment measures. Labs should consider not reporting Ct values on a routine basis.(Lancelot Pinto is a Consultant Respirologist at P.D. Hinduja National Hospital and Medical Research Centre, Mumbai)The Ct value is dynamic and can evolve rapidly. A low Ct value at the time of diagnosis does not mean that it will stay low the next day (as the body’s immunity kicks in)

"hat is the earliest record of a solar storm? Through analysis of ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica, a research team has found evidence of an extreme solar storm that occurred about 9,200 years ago. What puzzles the researchers is that the storm took place during one of the sun's more quiet phases — during which it is generally believed our planet is less exposed to such events. It is currently believed that solar storms are more likely during the so-called sunspot cycle. Research now shows
(Nature Communications)
that this may not always be the case for very large storms.
“We have studied drill cores from Greenland and Antarctica, and discovered traces of a massive solar storm that hit Earth during one of the Sun’s passive phases about 9,200 years ago,” Raimund Muscheler, geology researcher at Lund University says in a press release.The researchers scoured the drill cores for peaks of the radioactive isotopes beryllium-10 and chlorine-36. These are produced by high-energy cosmic particles that reach Earth, and can be preserved in ice and sediment. Cosmogenic radionuclides, such as carbon-14, beryllium-10 and chlorine-36, are produced within the Earth’s atmosphere as a result of the interactions of galactic cosmic rays (GCR) with its constituents and are modulated by the solar and the Earth’s magnetic fields. The enhanced flux of relatively lower energy particles during a solar energetic particle event (SEP) can trigger additional production of cosmogenic radionuclides, leaving an imprint in environmental archives.

This suggests that the sub-lineage BA.2 has a “selective advantage” over the original Omicron variant — BA.1 sub-lineage.Cluster of sequencesThe BA.2 has a “cluster of sequences that share many of the same mutations as the ‘original’ Omicron (BA.1) but is missing some mutations and has some other new ones,” Dr Emma Hodcroft, co-developer of Next Strain tweeted.A few studies are now discovering that BA.2 sub-lineage has even higher propensity to spread among people and has the ability to infect people who have been fully vaccinated and/or previously infected by escaping from neutralising antibodies induced by vaccination or infection.A study was carried out in 24 individuals who were fully vaccinated and received a booster shot of the Pfizer vaccine and eight participants who were naturally infected with SARS-CoV-2. In people who have been fully vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine, compared with the Wuhan strain, there was a 23-fold and 27-fold reduction in median neutralising antibody titres to BA.1 and BA.2, respectively. The results were posted in a preprint server
medRxiv on February 7. Preprints are yet to be peer-reviewed.Good protectionTwo weeks after a booster shot, the reduction in median neutralising antibody titres to BA.1 and BA.2 was only 6.1-fold and 8.4-fold, respectively, compared with the Wuhan strain. The neutralising antibody titres to BA.2 were about 1.4-fold lower than BA.1. From a public health perspective, the study found that when vaccinated individuals were infected with BA.1, they developed robust neutralising antibodies against BA.2. So BA.1 infection in vaccinated people offered good protection against BA.2.The differences in protection to BA.1 and BA.2 in both fully vaccinated and those who received a booster shot were not sufficiently different to explain why BA.2 is spreading widely in many regions of the world.Difference in resistanceAnother study by a team led by Dr. Dan H. Barouch from the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. found that both BA.1 and BA.2 had comparable ability to escape neutralising antibodies in people who are either fully vaccinated or naturally infected. Using a panel of 19 neutralising monoclonal antibodies as probes, the researchers found that like BA.1, BA.2 also totally or severely resisted 17 of 19 monoclonal antibodies but with certain critical differences. BA.1 was more resistant to one class of antibodies than BA.2, while BA.2 was more resistant to another class of antibodies tested. The results were posted as a preprint in
bioRxiv sever on February 9.“These findings have important public health implications and suggest that the increasing BA.2 frequency in the context of the BA.1 surge is likely related to increased transmissibility rather than enhanced immunologic escape,” Dr. Dan H. Barouch and others write.More infectiousAnother study carried out in over 8,500 Danish households that were infected with the Omicron variant by a team led by Frederik Plesner Lyngse from the Danish Ministry of Health, Copenhagen, Denmark, found that unvaccinated, fully vaccinated and those who have received a booster shot were more susceptible to infection by BA.2 than BA.1. In short, BA.2 was more infectious than BA.1.Surprisingly, the “relative increase in susceptibility was significantly greater in vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals which points towards immune evasive properties of the BA.2 conferring an even greater advantage for BA.2 in a highly vaccinated population such as Denmark,” the researchers note.Unvaccinated people infected with BA.2 had greater transmissibility than those who were infected by BA.1. But this difference between BA.1 and BA.2 was not seen in people who have been fully vaccinated or among those who have taken a booster shot. The results are posted on a preprint server
medRxiv on January 30, this year.“We conclude that Omicron BA.2 is inherently substantially more transmissible than BA.1, and that it also possesses immune-evasive properties that further reduce the protective effect of vaccination against infection, but do not increase its transmissibility from vaccinated individuals with breakthrough infections,” the Danish researchers write.Hamster experimentsAnother study posted as preprint in
bioRxiv found that in cell culture, BA.2 had higher ability to replicate in human nasal epithelial cells and also the ability to fuse with cells was higher.Importantly, infection experiments using hamsters showed that BA.2 is more pathogenic than BA.1, the authors write.In January, another sub-lineage of Omicron — BA.3 — was detected. It has 33 mutations in the spike protein. But none of the mutations are novel. Of the 33 mutations, 31 are seen in BA.1 as well, and the remaining two are seen in BA.2.Compared with BA.1 and BA.2, the BA.3 sub-lineage is marked by slow spread. One reason could be the absence of six mutations seen in BA.1, according to an article in the
BMJ .Surprisingly, the “relative increase in susceptibility was significantly greaterin vaccinated individuals.

"stronomical observations suggest that a significant part of the universe is made up of dark matter which interacts with the rest of the universe only through the gravitational pull. Many large lab experiments have tried to detect elementary particles that could be candidates for dark matter. However, such dark matter particles have not been detected until now. So, the question arises – could dark matter be composed, at least partly, of compact objects such as black holes? New research by an international team of scientists, presents a new way of addressing this question. The paper has been accepted for publication in
The Astrophysical Journal Letters.Several astronomical observations suggest that all galaxies are embedded in a “halo” of dark matter. The “visible” galaxy is like a disc embedded in a dark matter halo that is much larger in size. “One hypothesis is that dark matter comprises a large number of compact objects such as primordial black holes,” says P. Ajith from International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, Bengaluru, in an email to The Hindu.He is the senior author of the paper and an expert on gravitational waves.Primordial black holesWhen the universe was very young, hot and dense – soon after the Big Bang, it must have had quantum fluctuations of its density. This, in turn, would have caused some regions to become extremely dense, and therefore, to collapse under their own gravity to form the primordial black holes.“While we have no conclusive evidence of spotting these objects, some of the binary black hole mergers detected by the LIGO gravitational wave detectors might be primordial black holes. The question is open,” says Prof. Ajith. From a theoretical standpoint, there is good reason to believe that primordial black holes did form in the young universe.Gravitational lensingThe paper explores what happens when such objects get in the way of gravitational waves travelling towards the Earth from the distance. They invoke a phenomenon called gravitational lensing that is used regularly in astronomy. When light travels through space and passes near a massive or compact body – a star, a galaxy or a black hole, for example, the intense gravity of that body may attract the light towards it, bending it from its rectilinear (straight line) path.This phenomenon is known as gravitational lensing and was first observed by Arthur Eddington in 1919. Massive objects like galaxies can bend light significantly, producing multiple images, this is called strong lensing. Lighter objects like stars or black holes bend light less, and this is called microlensing. A similar lensing can happen to gravitational waves travelling towards the Earth, and this would leave signatures in the detected gravitational waves. This can be used to detect the presence, or the existence, of primordial black holes.Assessing dark matterUntil now, individual black holes have not marked out these signatures on gravitational waves detected by the LIGO-VIRGO detectors. However, if all of the dark matter is made of primordial black holes, they should have produced detectable signatures on the gravitational wave signals. The researchers use the non-observation of the lensing signatures to assess what fraction of the dark matter could be made of black holes.New avenue“This provides a new way of constraining the nature of dark matter,” says Prof Ajith. He adds, “Our study concludes that black holes in the mass range from a hundred to a million solar masses can contribute only up to 50-80% of the dark matter in the universe.” This is an upper limit and the actual fraction can be much smaller. “These upper limits will get better and better with more and more observations.”The work is significant in being the first to use this method, which presents a new avenue for probing dark matter.While we have no conclusive evidence of spotting these objects, some of the black hole mergers detected by the LIGO detectors might be primordial black holes.P.

"bservations showing a roughly dough-nut-shaped cloud of cosmic dust and gas shrouding a huge black hole at the heart of a galaxy similar in size to our Milky Way are providing scientists with new clarity about the universe's most energetic objects.Scientists said on Wednesday that their observations involving the supermassive black hole at the centre of galaxy Messier 77 and its surrounding cloud lend support to predictions made three decades ago about what are called “active galactic nuclei.”Centres of activityThese are places at the centres of many large galaxies that have tremendous luminosity – sometimes outshining all of a galaxy's billions of stars combined – and produce the universe's most energetic outbursts seen since the Big Bang event 13.8 billion years ago. The energy arises from gas violently falling into a supermassive black hole that is surrounded by a cloud of tiny particles of rock and soot along with mostly hydrogen gas.Black holes are extraordinarily dense objects possessing gravitational pulls so powerful even light cannot escape them. Supermassive black holes, which reside at the centre of many galaxies, including our own, are the largest of them.Messier 77, also called NGC 1068 or the Squid Galaxy, is located 47 million light years – the distance light travels in a year, 9.5 trillion km – from the Earth in the constellation Cetus. Its supermassive black hole has a mass roughly 10 million times greater than our sun.Unified modelThe observations, using the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope in Chile’s Atacama Desert, provided strong support for what is called the “unified model” of active galactic nuclei. This model holds that all active galactic nuclei are basically the same but that some appear from the vantage point of Earth to have different properties.Some look intensely bright because the position of theirring-like cloud does not obscure the gas plummeting into the black hole from our viewing angle. Others look dark because thecloud blocks our view of what is truly happening.Messier 77's active galactic nucleus is one of the dark ones, but the new observations indicate that it actually possesses the same qualities as the bright ones.Strong attraction""The dust and gas in these clouds are probably blown out of the atmospheres of stars at a larger distance – hundreds of light years – from the black hole, and are falling in towards the centre under the influence of the black hole gravity,"" said Violeta Gamez Rosas, an astronomy doctoral student at Leiden University in the Netherlands and lead author of the research published in the journal
Nature.""Some clouds spiral in towards the black hole while others are pushed up into a 'fountain' that falls back onto the galaxy. Because of the dust, it is very difficult to see with telescopes what is going on in this region, but it is easier at infrared wavelengths than at normal visible wavelengths because the dust does not absorb infrared light as much,"" said study co-author Walter Jaffe, a Leiden University astronomy professor.The Milky Way's supermassive black hole, which has a mass 4 million times greater than the Sun, is currently ""fairly quiet,"" Gamez Rosas said, but previously may have been more active like Messier 77's.Gamez Rosas expressed satisfaction at studying active galactic nuclei.""A lot of it is pure fascination with explosions on such gigantic scales, and the challenge of trying to explain them with what we think we know about physics,"" Gamez Rosas said.""There is also the challenge of trying to build and operate telescopes to make these images of things so far away,"" Gamez Rosas added. ""And there is the peace of mind that results from the knowledge that there is a large, complex, varied universe that goes its own way whatever we do on Earth.""Some supermassive black holes look intensely bright because the position of theirring-like cloud does not obscure the gas plummeting into the black hole from our viewing angle.

"stronomers of National Centre of Radio Astrophysics (NCRA-TIFR) in Pune and the University of California in the U.S. have used the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) to map the distribution of atomic hydrogen gas from the host galaxy of a fast radio burst (FRB) for the first time.Fast radio burstsFast radio bursts are extremely bright radio pulses from distant galaxies that last for only a few milliseconds, and though they were first detected fifteen years ago and over a thousand have been found so far, researchers still don't know what kind of astronomical objects can produce so much energy in so little time.The exercise has revealed exciting clues about the origin of the burst.""The GMRT results indicate the FRB host galaxy has undergone a recent merger and that the FRB progenitor is most likely a massive star formed due to this merger event. This is the first case of direct evidence for a recent merger in an FRB host, a major step towards understanding the progenitors of FRBs,"" Balpreet Kaur, a PhD student at NCRA-TIFR and the lead author of the study, said.""Observations of the gas and stars in the vicinity of FRBs and within their host galaxies are critical to understanding how the bursts were formed,"" Kaur said, adding that their target FRB (FRB20180916B) produces repeated, very short bursts, and these have been found to arise in the outskirts of a spiral galaxy half a billion light-years away.She said FRB20180916B is thus one of the closest known FRBs, an ideal candidate to study the local burst environment.Professor Nissim Kanekar, who is co-author in the research, said GMRT was apt for conducting such studies as one can use different combinations of the 30 GMRT antennas to map the atomic hydrogen within the FRB host galaxy in detail.This is the first case of direct evidence for a recent merger in an FRB host, they said.

"s the ability of humans to sense smell changing?Variations in the genes for the newly discovered scent receptors for musk and underarm odour add to a growing body of research suggesting that humans' sense of smell is gradually becoming less sensitive
(PLOS Genetics).Scientists can combine differences in scent perception with a person's genetics to discover the role of various scent receptors. In a new study, a team of researchers from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China, screened genomes of 1,000 Han Chinese people to find genetic variations linked to how the participants perceived 10 different scents. Then they repeated the experiment for six odours in an ethnically diverse population of 364 people to confirm their results. The team identified two new receptors, one that detects a synthetic musk used in fragrances and another for a compound in human underarm odour, says release from
PLOS .Degraded abilityIn combination with previously published results, the researchers find that people with the ancestral versions (the version shared with other non-human primates) of the scent receptors tend to rate the corresponding odour as more intense. This supports the hypothesis that the sensitivity to smells of humans and other primates has degraded over time due to changes in the genes that code for our smell recepto",0,1,0,0

In a population of Colorado blue columbines, researchers observed that flowers lost some of their petals and their characteristic nectar spurs due to a specific mutation, according to a study published in
Current Biology . The researchers infer that these types of change are examples of evolution that happens in jumps and not in gradual steps as Darwin envisaged.
